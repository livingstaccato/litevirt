// The fleet tests build their PKI in a temp directory and drive corrosion
// directly, so they prove the cryptography and the merge rules but say nothing
// about the two things that actually decide whether this works in production:
// whether the daemon can read the key material `lv host init` laid down on a
// real node, and whether the private key is protected on disk. A signing scheme
// whose key is world-readable is theatre — anyone who can read the file can
// forge the whole log — and no in-process test can see the file mode.
//
// These run on a cluster node (localMode) because they read the daemon's PKI
// directory and its database. From a workstation there is nothing to inspect,
// so they skip rather than pretend.

// auditPKIDir is where a node keeps its cluster identity, which is also its
// audit signing key. Matches pki_dir in the daemon config.

// — the certificate chains to the cluster CA and the CN matches, so nothing
// downstream has any reason to object. This is the one property of the whole
// design that lives in the filesystem rather than the code.
// It also covers every private key the node holds, not just the one that
// shipped loose: ca.key can mint an identity for any host in the cluster, and
// audit-signing.key is what a rotation installs precisely because the key it
// replaced was exposed. The repair runs at every daemon start regardless of
// enforcement.audit_signature — it used to hang off that flag, which then
// defaulted to false, so an operator who upgraded specifically for this fix and left the
