// Fleet scenarios for DELEGATED project-quota admission (F2 second half).
//
// Reserve-then-verify makes two concurrent admissions pick a winner, but only once
// both reservations are VISIBLE to both deciders. Corrosion is eventually consistent,
// so two nodes that have not yet exchanged rows each see only their own claim and
// both admit — together exceeding a quota neither request individually broke.
//
// That failure is structurally unreachable from a single-package test: it needs two
// daemons with genuinely separate replicas, deciding at the same time, over real
// gRPC. This harness gives exactly that — nothing converges between two nodes unless
// a scenario explicitly pulls, so the lag window can be held open for as long as the
// assertion needs instead of being raced against a timer.
