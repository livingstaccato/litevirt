// admissionIntent names the two INDEPENDENT facts an admission needs about the
// action it is deciding, which one boolean used to conflate:
//
//   - newResidency: the action makes a workload RESIDENT on the target host
//     (create, start, migrate-in, restore-in, fresh promotion). This is the
//     SAFETY fact: incomplete or unattributable local inventory refuses new
//     residency regardless of the numeric delta, because an uncapped container
//     asks the ledger for nothing and still lands on the host.
//   - vmOverhead: the target receives a qemu DOMAIN, so the HOST figures carry
//     the per-domain memory overhead. Host-only, never project quota — the
//     hypervisor's cost of running the guest, not memory the tenant asked for.
//
// Containers become resident without ever paying qemu overhead; a resource grow
// of a running workload is neither. Conflating the two is what let container
// callers opt out of residency safety by (correctly) declining VM overhead.

// the same project on different hosts each read a view that did not yet contain the
// other, both passed, and both persisted — the cluster ends up over its own limits
// with neither request having done anything wrong. Even the one path that already
// carried a reservation vector wrote it AFTER its check (resize.go), so two
// concurrent resizes raced identically; the vector only protected against
// operations that had started earlier still being in flight.
//
// Inverting the order closes it without a central coordinator:
//
//	reserve — persist a nonterminal operation carrying this admission's deltas
//	verify  — re-read headroom, which nets out EVERY nonterminal reservation,
//	          adding back our own and any LATER claimant's
//	release — free the provisional reservation, whatever the outcome
//
// Adding our own back is what keeps the comparison honest: headroom already
// subtracted our demand, so verifying "delta fits in headroom" without it would
// double-count and refuse admissions that fit.
//
// Deterministic tie-break. If both racers simply refused, the cluster would be safe
// but nobody would get in; the useful property is that exactly ONE proceeds.
// Reservations are ordered by operation id — globally unique, so the order is total
// and every node derives the same winner — and an admission yields only to
// reservations that sort BEFORE it. The earliest claimant wins; later ones see their
// own reservation excluded, find the earlier one still consuming headroom, and
// stand down.

// KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than papered over: this closes the race whenever both
// reservations are VISIBLE to both deciders. Corrosion is eventually consistent, so
// two nodes that have not yet exchanged operation rows can still both admit. Closing

// admitQuotaWithReservation admits a grow against PROJECT QUOTA ONLY — no host
// figures. Three callers need exactly this shape:
//
//   - container creates: host capacity charges memory only (cpu_limit is cgroup
//     shares, not a vCPU reservation), but quota charges BOTH — SumProjectUsage
//     counts a container's cpu_limit against the project vCPU budget, so admission
//     must too or the limit is unenforceable;
//   - --allow-overcommit: the operator is bypassing a PHYSICAL judgment, not a
//     tenancy limit, so quota still goes through serialized admission — the
//     unserialized fail-fast cannot see in-flight reservations, and concurrent
//     overcommit requests all observed the same headroom;
//   - a grow of an already-STOPPED VM: its spec counts toward SumProjectUsage but
//     it contributes nothing to host usage until StartVM admits the full size.
//
// delta is what the admission ASKS FOR and want is the ABSOLUTE size the
// workload will contribute once committed (equal for a create, larger than the
// delta for a grow). Both carry all four quota dimensions: disk and NIC are
// tenancy limits with no host analogue, and reserving them here is what makes
// them race-free — an unserialized read of committed usage cannot see a
// concurrent request's claim, so two creates each fitting the remaining disk (or
// NIC) budget both passed and both committed.
//
// The returned lease carries the commit fence like any other quota grant.
