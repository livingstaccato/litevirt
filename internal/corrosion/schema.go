// CurrentSchemaVersion is the schema version this binary expects. Bump this
// every time `schemaMigrations` grows. The daemon refuses to start if the
// local DB's persisted schema_version is HIGHER than this — that means
// someone is trying to downgrade onto a forward-migrated DB, which produces
// silent corruption (new columns the old binary doesn't know about, indexes
// it doesn't maintain, etc.).
//
// Schema versions are NOT replicated via CRDT — each host's local
// schema_state.version reflects its own binary's view.
//
// History:
//
//	v1: initial baseline
//	v2: auth — roles, role_bindings, sessions, user_2fa,
//	    recovery_codes; tokens scope columns; users.realm column
//	v3: distributed firewall — security_groups, sg_rules tables.
//	v4: per-NIC SG binding — vm_interfaces.security_groups
//	    column.
//	v5: containers — containers cluster-state table.
//	v6: federation — hosts.region column, service_endpoints
//	    table.
//	v7: snapshot scheduler — backup_schedules table.
//	v8: tamper-evident audit log — audit_log.prev_hash +
//	    audit_log.content_hash columns.
//	v9:  tenancy core — projects + project_quotas tables;
//	     vms.project column.
//	v10: pool-level schedules — backup_schedules.pool_name
//	     column.
//	v11: pool CRUD — storage_pools.options column (JSON
//	     blob of driver-specific key/value flags so operators can
//	     register a pool at runtime without editing config.yaml).
//	v12: backup-schedule scopes — backup_schedules.scope +
//	     project_name columns. A schedule now targets a VM, a storage
//	     pool, all VMs (cluster), or a tenancy project; the scheduler
//	     fans the non-vm scopes out per host at tick time. vm_name
//	     holds a sentinel key for non-vm scopes (@pool:X / @project:Y /
//	     @cluster) so multiple scopes can share a repo under the
//	     (vm_name, repo) primary key.
//	v13: per-VM event store — vm_events table (durable, CRDT-replicated,
//	     append-only, prunable operational activity history; distinct
//	     from the tamper-evident audit_log hash chain). New CREATE TABLE
//	     only — schemaMigrations does not grow.
//	v14: tenancy backup_gib aggregation — vm_backups table indexing the
//	     latest backup size per (vm, disk, repo), upserted on each backup
//	     push so SumProjectUsage can gate the backup_gib quota on live usage.
//	     New CREATE TABLE only — schemaMigrations does not grow.
//	v16: VM templates + clones — vms.is_template (a VM that can't start;
//	     its disks are immutable clone sources) + vm_disks.backing_disk
//	     (linked-clone lineage, for the refcount + host-pin guards). Additive.
//	v15: TOTP replay protection — user_2fa.last_step column (highest
//	     consumed TOTP time-step). VerifyTOTP ratchets this forward and
//	     rejects any code at or below it, so a captured code can't be
//	     replayed inside its ±30s validity window. Additive; old rows
//	     default to 0 and accept their first code.
//
// IMPORTANT: bump this in lockstep with any addition to schemaDDL or
// schemaMigrations. Without the bump the cross-version replication
// skew check in internal/grpcapi/sync.go can't tell that a peer is
// missing newly-added tables/columns, and ApplyRemoteMutations will
// silently drop rows that reference them (see replicator.go ~L608).
//
//	v17: scheduled replication — backup_schedules gains type ('backup' |
//	     'replication'), target_pool, target_host, keep_replicas, so the
//	     existing scheduler can drive volume replication alongside backups.
//	     Additive; old rows default type='backup'. gap-1 from v16, auto-prestaged.
//	v18: replication follow-ups B + C — backup_schedules gains incremental
//	     (transfer only dirty extents into raw replicas; full-copy fallback),
//	     auto_promote (failover may promote the freshest replica on host loss),
//	     and last_checkpoint (the per-schedule dirty-bitmap chain anchor for the
//	     incremental path). Additive; old rows default incremental=0,
//	     auto_promote=0, last_checkpoint=''.
//	v19: VM features & data safety (Proxmox-gap MR1) — snapshots gains type
//	     ('disk'|'memory'), vmstate_path, vmstate_size_bytes for live/RAM
//	     snapshots (#3); new resource_mappings table for cluster-wide passthrough
//	     device aliases (#14). Memory ballooning (#4) and boot ordering (#10) live
//	     in the VMSpec JSON, so they need no columns. Additive throughout.
//	v20: notifications (Proxmox-gap MR2 #5) — new notification_targets +
//	     notification_routes tables (webhook/slack targets + event-pattern routes).
//	     New CREATE TABLE only — schemaMigrations does not grow. ACME (#13) is
//	     config-only, no schema.
//	v21: distributed-firewall wire-up — the renderer already supported cluster/host
//	     tiers, default-deny, and ipsets, but nothing persisted them. New tables:
//	     ip_sets (named CIDR lists), cluster_firewall_rules + host_firewall_rules
//	     (the two non-NIC tiers), firewall_defaults (per-scope default-deny policy,
//	     scope = 'cluster' or a host name). Compose security-groups/ipsets/firewall
//	     blocks and per-NIC bindings now feed these. Also adds backup_repos
//	     (logical name → path) so a compose `backup-repos:` block can register a
//	     repo cluster-wide (previously repos came only from daemon config). New
//	     CREATE TABLE only — schemaMigrations does not grow.
//	v22: per-VM replication checkpoints — new replication_checkpoints table keyed
//	     by (vm_name, repo). Incremental replication's dirty-bitmap anchor used to
//	     live in backup_schedules.last_checkpoint, but for fan-out (pool/cluster/
//	     project) schedules that row's vm_name is a sentinel, so per-VM checkpoint
//	     writes matched zero rows and incremental silently degraded to full copies.
//	     Keying by the real VM fixes both per-VM and fan-out scopes. New CREATE
//	     TABLE only — schemaMigrations does not grow.
//	v23: registry credentials — new registry_credentials table holding per-user
//	     (scope='user', owner=<username>) and global (scope='global') OCI/Docker
//	     registry logins, used to authenticate `lv ct pull` / PullOCIImage against
//	     private registries. New CREATE TABLE (+ one partial unique index) only —
//	     schemaMigrations does not grow. SECURITY: the `secret` column is stored
//	     PLAINTEXT (matching the current user_2fa TOTP convention) and replicates
//	     cluster-wide via Corrosion; AES-GCM sealing is future work, gated on
//	     cluster-master-key infrastructure that does not yet exist.
//	v24: container restart policy — containers gains restart_policy (JSON:
//	     condition/delay/max_attempts/window) + state_detail (the stop-cause /
//	     intent channel, mirroring vms.state_detail: 'operator-stop' etc.) so the
//	     new container reconciler can auto-restart a container that stopped
//	     unexpectedly while leaving an operator-stopped one alone. New
//	     container_restarts table (mirrors vm_restarts) tracks attempts within a
//	     sliding window. Additive: the two columns get ALTERs in schemaMigrations
//	     and CREATE-TABLE columns; old rows default restart_policy='' (treated as
//	     'none') and state_detail=''. gap-1 from v23, auto-prestaged.
//	v25: containers.project — a tenancy project bucket on the containers table,
//	     mirroring vms.project. ADD COLUMN in schemaMigrations + CREATE-TABLE
//	     column; old rows default project='_default'. Unblocks container quota
//	     admission, audit-actor, and per-project RBAC (paths were hardcoded to
//	     /projects/_default/containers/). gap-1 from v24, auto-prestaged.
//	v26: container_backups — indexes the latest full-backup size per (container,
//	     repo), mirroring vm_backups, so the tenancy backup_gib quota sums
//	     container footprints alongside VMs. New table in schemaDDL only (no
//	     ALTER — CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS covers fresh + existing DBs). Unblocks
//	     container backup/restore (full tar → pbsstore). gap-1 from v25.
//	v27: container_snapshots — per-container point-in-time snapshots (freeze+tar
//	     of the container dir under {dataDir}/ct-snapshots), the container analogue
//	     of the snapshots table. New table in schemaDDL only (no ALTER). Unblocks
//	     `lv ct snapshot create|ls|revert|rm`. gap-1 from v26.
//	v28: containers.is_template + containers.on_host_failure — clone-source
//	     template flag (mirrors vms.is_template) and host-loss relocation policy.
//	     Two ADD COLUMNs in schemaMigrations + CREATE-TABLE columns; old rows
//	     default is_template=0, on_host_failure=NULL (treated as 'none'). Unblocks
//	     container templates/clones (B4) + failover relocation (B5). gap-1 from v27.
//	v29: delete-safety — tokens.updated_at + lb_backends.deleted_at. Anti-entropy is
//	     a union merge that can't propagate hard deletes, so full-state tables must
//	     soft-delete (deleted_at) and arbitrate by updated_at. tokens had deleted_at
//	     but no updated_at, so a stale peer's live row blind-replaced a revocation;
//	     lb_backends had neither and was hard-deleted. Two ADD COLUMNs; old tokens
//	     rows default updated_at='' (a revoke's timestamp then wins LWW). gap-1 from v28.
//	v30: hosts.schema_version — each host's running-binary supported schema (the
//	     value Ping returns, i.e. that binary's CurrentSchemaVersion; NOT the
//	     DB-applied EffectiveDBSchema). Persisted so the self-upgrade watcher reads
//	     peer (version, schema) from the replicated hosts table instead of an
//	     O(N^2) live-Ping fan-out. Additive INTEGER DEFAULT 0; old rows read 0
//	     (unknown → never an upgrade source) until the peer writes its own at boot.
//	     gap-1 from v29.
//	v31: lb_configs.generation + lb_backends.generation — a per-incarnation token
//	     (minted on create/recreate, preserved on edit). Readers render only the
//	     backends whose generation matches their lb_config's, so a stale backend a
//	     partitioned peer held (and this node never saw) can merge under anti-entropy
//	     but never renders — closing the LB OR-set edge. Additive TEXT DEFAULT '';
//	     pre-migration rows match '' = '' and keep rendering. gap-1 from v30.
//	v32: make 2FA/recovery peer-repairable so they can join the sensitive
//	     anti-entropy lane, each gated by a per-user active-set pointer so a stale
//	     row a partitioned peer resurrects can never validate (the soft-delete
//	     tombstone alone can't cover a factor/code this node never saw):
//	       - user_2fa.deleted_at + user_2fa.epoch, with a new
//	         user_2fa_sets(username PK, active_epoch, updated_at, deleted_at). A
//	         factor renders only when its epoch == the pointer's active_epoch;
//	         DeleteUser tombstones the pointer, so delete→recreate can't resurrect.
//	       - recovery_codes.set_id + updated_at + deleted_at, with a new
//	         recovery_code_sets(username PK, active_set_id, updated_at, deleted_at).
//	         A code is valid only when its set_id == active_set_id.
//	     Both pointers converge by ordinary updated_at LWW (no numeric/MAX
//	     generation ordering, which per-node-monotonic NowTS would make unsafe).
//	     Five ADD COLUMNs + two CREATE TABLEs; gap-1 from v31. InitSchema runs
//	     idempotent post-migration data fixes (user_2fa NULL→'' label; legacy
//	     2FA/recovery pointer backfill) via raw SQL, not replicated mutations.
//	v33: host_runtime_usage(host_name PK, disk_iops, net_mbps, updated_at,
//	     deleted_at) — a per-host runtime-telemetry row the placement engine reads
//	     to score the DiskIOPS/NetBW dimensions. Kept OUT of the full-state
//	     anti-entropy set (antiEntropyExcluded): it replicates via mutation_log but
//	     stale telemetry self-corrects on the next sample (cf. vm_events), so it
//	     needn't be full-state-repaired and must not bloat the digest/dump or churn
//	     durable host metadata. One CREATE TABLE; gap-1 from v32.
//	v34: containers.create_spec — JSON of a container's create-time intent
//	     (template/distro/release/arch + litevirt-managed networks) that the other
//	     columns don't capture. Lets host-loss relocation and restore rebuild a
//	     container faithfully (networking included) instead of a bare image
//	     recreate. Forward-only: rows/manifests from before v34 have an empty spec;
//	     readers tolerate that and fall back to image-recreate. Plus
//	     containers.relocate_token: an attempt token a restore-relocation stamps on
//	     the target row so the coordinator can PROVE a (target,name) row is its own
//	     restore (names aren't cluster-unique) before tombstoning the source. Two
//	     ADD COLUMNs; gap-1 from v33.
//	v35: container_interfaces(host_name, ct_name, network_name, ordinal, mac, ip,
//	     veth_device, security_groups, updated_at, deleted_at; PK
//	     (host_name,ct_name,ordinal)) — the container analogue of vm_interfaces,
//	     giving every litevirt-managed container NIC a cluster row + a stable,
//	     deterministic host veth device so IPAM/DNS/security-groups can apply to
//	     containers like VMs. PK keyed by ordinal (not network) to allow multiple
//	     NICs on one network. One CREATE TABLE; gap-1 from v34.
//	v36: ip_allocations.owner_kind ('vm'|'ct', DEFAULT 'vm') + owner_host
//	     (DEFAULT '') — generalize IPAM ownership beyond VMs. Leases now key on
//	     (network, owner_kind, owner_host, vm_name): VMs keep an empty owner_host
//	     (names are cluster-global), containers use their host (CT names are
//	     per-host), so a VM and a CT — or two same-named CTs on different hosts —
//	     can't alias to one lease. Old rows default to owner_kind='vm'/owner_host=''
//	     preserving VM behavior. Two ADD COLUMNs; gap-1 from v35.
//	v37: project-scoped isolation — networks.project, storage_pools.project,
//	     volumes.project (all TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''). EMPTY = global/shared
//	     (usable by every project — the deliberate admin escape hatch); a non-empty
//	     value means owned + isolated, so a workload may only attach to a network/
//	     pool that is global OR owned by its own project. DEFAULT '' makes every
//	     pre-v37 network/pool/volume global, so no existing workload is suddenly
//	     denied (a '_default' default would have done exactly that). Three ADD
//	     COLUMNs; gap-1 from v36.
//	v38: split-brain hardening (Phase 1) — new table runtime_action_proofs (durable
//	     single-use runtime-ownership authorization with a monotone action lifecycle;
//	     NON-LWW merge, kept off replication until split_brain_gate_v1 is cluster-wide)
//	     + vms.pending_action_id (TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '') linking a pending start to
//	     its proof. One CREATE TABLE + one ADD COLUMN; gap-1 from v37.
//	v39: request idempotency — new table idempotency_keys(key PK, claim_id, method,
//	     request_hash, response, status, expires_at, …) recording a mutating RPC so a
//	     lost-response retry to the SAME entry node replays the original result
//	     instead of executing twice. LOCAL-only (execLocal, never replicated) and
//	     TTL-reaped (ephemeral); cross-node retries fall back to resource-name
//	     uniqueness. One CREATE TABLE; gap-1 from v38.
//	v40: firewall consolidation — new table host_fw_intent recording this host's
//	     resolved NAT (masquerade), SNAT, and host-isolation decisions so the single
//	     canonical nftables renderer emits them in the atomic litevirt-fw table
//	     replace (previously out-of-band iptables + a second nft table). LOCAL-only
//	     (execLocal, never replicated) — nft rules are per-host state; provisioning /
//	     LB apply write intent, the firewall reconciler renders it. One CREATE TABLE;
//	     gap-1 from v39.
//	v41: F1 operation-journal foundation — vms gains vm_owner_epoch + spec_generation
//	     (per-VM monotonic ABA-proof recovery state, ruleNumericMax on an exact-ts tie)
//	     and active_operation_id (the VM-wide mutation barrier pointing at the in-flight
//	     operations row, carved out of LWW like pending_action_id). New immutable /
//	     append-only tables operations, operation_steps, project_authority_epochs — the
//	     replicated tier of the crash-recoverable operation journal, merged by a bespoke
//	     non-LWW immutable-row merge (identical→idempotent, facts-conflict→unresolved+
//	     flagged, tombstone dominates). Three ADD COLUMN + three CREATE TABLE; gap-1 from v40.
//	v42: hardware foundation — vm_nics, vm_pci_intent, vm_pci_realizations;
//	     vm_disks.{bus,device_kind,delete_with_vm,controller_model};
//	     vms.{hardware_adoption_state,hardware_adoption_error}.
//	v43: per-host capacity policy — hosts.{cpu_overcommit,mem_overcommit,
//	     cpu_reserve,mem_reserve_mib}. Overrides the cluster-wide default so a
//	     host with swap/KSM can overcommit memory while its peers do not. Ratio 0
//	     and reserve -1 mean "inherit the cluster default"; 0 is a MEANINGFUL
//	     reserve (hand guests everything), so absence had to be a distinct value.
//	     Four ADD COLUMN.
//	v44: workload lifecycle + scoped notification routing — containers gains
//	     owner_epoch/spec_generation/active_operation_id, hosts gains the
//	     capacity-policy fingerprint used by admission compatibility checks, and
//	     notification_routes gains subject_pattern/project selectors. Six
//	     additive columns with legacy-compatible defaults.
//	v45: audit tamper-evidence — audit_log gains key_id/signature/seq so a row
//	     carries an ECDSA signature over its content hash, chain position and
//	     sequence number, plus audit_signing_keys (the per-host verification
//	     certificate, replicated so any node can check any host's chain) and
//	     audit_chain_heads (append-only signed heads, which is the only way to
//	     detect truncation — a hash chain links backward and cannot notice that
//	     its own tail was removed). Three additive columns, two new tables.
//	v46: audit signing key rotation — audit_key_lifecycle, an append-only table
//	     of SIGNED 'adopted' and 'retired' events bounding each key's signing
//	     contract. Retirement is a validity WINDOW, never a deletion: the
//	     certificate has to stay resolvable for as long as any row it signed
//	     exists, or rotating a key would make the history it signed
//	     unverifiable. It carries a signature because the detector for "somebody
//	     else has this key" cannot itself be something somebody else can write —
//	     a retirement is an assertion by the retired key itself (a voluntary
//	     stop), by a successor key of the same host (a rotation), or by the
//	     cluster CA (a host that can no longer speak for itself). Append-only
//	     means deleting one locally is repaired by ordinary anti-entropy rather
//	     than needing a bespoke merge rule. Adoption is recorded the same way,
//	     because the certificate alone cannot say WHEN a host committed —
//	     without that, publishing one retroactively puts a cluster's entire
//	     history under the contract. One new table.
//
//	v47: cluster_crl — the CA-signed certificate revocation list, replicated so a
//	     revocation reaches every node the way every other cluster fact does.
//	     Previously nothing wrote a CRL at all, and removing a host was enforced
//	     solely by the tombstone on its `hosts` row; a node that never received
//	     that tombstone went on accepting the removed host's certificate. Safe to
//	     replicate in the clear because a CRL is signed by the cluster CA — a peer
//	     can write the row but cannot forge one that verifies, and every reader
//	     checks the signature before installing it. One new table.
//	v48: host_networks — declarative host network intent (§O Tier 1: bridges,
//	     bonds, VLAN interfaces, physical-NIC addressing). One row per named
//	     interface per host; ONLY the owning host renders its rows into
//	     /etc/netplan/90-litevirt.yaml behind the journaled apply-with-rollback
//	     protocol. Replicated (unlike host_fw_intent) because the intent is the
//	     operator-facing object: the UI/CLI list every host's interfaces from
//	     any node, and a host that lost its DB re-learns its own wiring intent
//	     from peers. Deliberately NOT part of the Phase 4 workload-ownership
//	     regime — host_name in the PK is the ownership, and only that host
//	     writes state transitions. One new table.
//	v49: hosts.isolation_epoch / isolation_reason — the §A isolation epoch. A
//	     node whose local state was produced outside the cluster's current
//	     compatibility regime (rolled back below a latched token, or isolated
//	     by an operator) is recorded as isolated BY A HEALTHY PEER, and every
//	     peer then refuses its replication until a verified reseed clears it.
//	     Deliberately cluster state rather than a host-local marker: peers
//	     cannot refuse what they cannot see, and a node that cannot be trusted
//	     to replicate cannot be trusted to record its own quarantine. Monotone
//	     and peer-written; 0 = not isolated. Two additive columns.
//	v50: the durable cluster-health model. health_conditions (one row per
//	     detected condition with its observed→confirmed→resolved lifecycle and
//	     canonical evidence), health_evaluator_status (each evaluator's latest
//	     scan time and COVERAGE — absence of a condition only means something
//	     under complete coverage), and host_capacity_observations (per-host
//	     effective capacity over the union of database and runtime workloads,
//	     so a rogue runtime still consumes headroom in placement). Replaces
//	     the in-memory dual-run debounce, log-only findings, the connectivity
//	     matrix RPC, and the never-populated ClusterStatus.alerts: health is
//	     cluster STATE — it must survive detector leadership changes and
//	     daemon restarts, and every node must converge on one view of it.
//	     Also preserves quota_reservations, the durable reservation table introduced
//	     by upstream schema v44 after that version number had already been used by
//	     this integration line. The table remains replicated and understood during
//	     mixed-version operation; this branch keeps its existing authority-ledger
//	     admission implementation, so upstream's emitted statement shapes are
//	     retained as historical receiver contracts. Four new tables.
