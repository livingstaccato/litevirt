// The host-safety admission policy — ONE entrypoint consulted by every
// operator-driven create, start, restore, migrate, placement, and
// resource-growth admission. It reads the same durable health conditions the
// operator sees, so "lv health says CRITICAL" and "admission refused" can
// never disagree:
//
//   - an ACTIVE ownership condition (vm/ct dual-run, runtime-owner mismatch,
//     owner-epoch mismatch) blocks capacity-growing admission to every
//     involved host, and blocks runtime-changing actions on the affected
//     workload wherever it is — an observed (not yet confirmed) condition
//     already blocks: growing into a possibly-corrupting host is not a risk
//     admission gets to take while the evaluator finishes confirming;
//   - an INCOMPLETE local runtime inventory blocks NEW workloads from landing
//     on this host. The check is a fresh LOCAL probe, never replicated
//     telemetry — the target host answers for itself;
//   - --allow-overcommit bypasses numeric headroom ONLY; it cannot bypass
//     either of the above (reserveWithoutCheck consults this gate too);
//   - VIP dual-run is deliberately NOT consulted here: it blocks VIP/LB
//     ownership changes (checkVIPSafety), not unrelated VM placement.
