	// after stripping key_id/signature — and if unsigned rows are a normal, expected
	// outcome, `lv audit verify` cannot call them a forgery. Once this token is

	// legitimate state and starts being evidence.
	//
	// Advertised CONDITIONALLY on the local config flag, like OperationProtocolV1: a
	// node with the flag off still emits unsigned rows into the same cluster-wide
	// table, and a chain containing them proves nothing about the hosts that DID
	// sign. So the latch must require CONFIG uniformity, not just a uniform build —

//
// ALL currently-implemented tokens are now ADVERTISED. SplitBrainGateV1 has no kill
// switch (it flips via advertisement alone); every OTHER token is gated `configFlag &&
// latch` (enforcement.* / auth.*), so advertising it is behavior-neutral until an
// operator sets its flag — the flip is decoupled from enablement. Enforcement of any
// token still activates only once every enforcement-relevant member advertises it
// (fresh Ping) and it latches per node.
//
//   - Phase 1 (SplitBrainGateV1) — FLIPPED (no config flag): the composable dangerous-action gate. Machinery +
//     activation-hardening in place and tested — full proof carried+validated for
//     promote/ApplyLB/restore, relocation token-bound proof, promote crash-idempotent
//     step resume, token-gated per-peer WAL proof replication PLUS a peer-only
//     sensitive anti-entropy convergence net (both monotone-merged), mint sites that
//     fresh-Ping the destination before stamping, marker presence forcing BOTH the
//     ExecutionGate and proof validation at execute sites, and a per-token durable
//     activation LATCH (partition fails closed, never reverts to legacy).
//   - Phase 2 (VIPDemoteV1 + VIPReleaseProbeV1) — ADVERTISED, enforcement default-off (gated by
//     enforcement.vip_self_demote / enforcement.vip_proof_reclaim): minority VIP self-demotion + majority
//     proof-gated reclaim, DECOUPLED from the watchdog. VIPDemoteV1 (minority): an isolated
//     (quorum-lost) LB host stops keepalived + removes its own VIP address — WITHOUT a
//     hardware watchdog. VIPReleaseProbeV1 (majority trust): peers reclaim a VIP only on a
//     release proof — a by-VIP absence answer (direct CheckVIPParticipant or relayed) trusted
//     ONLY from a host advertising this token. A watchdog is an OPTIONAL backstop for one
//     corner: if the demote can't be CONFIRMED and a verified watchdog is armed the node
//     self-fences; if there's no verified self-fence it keeps retrying + raises HA-degraded,
//     and the majority stays in the safe gap (no reclaim without a release/fence proof — a
//     VIP outage, not a takeover). Warmup never demotes; a
//     sub-threshold blip never demotes (monotonic hysteresis); the startup-validated
//     timing invariant keeps the isolated side finishing before any majority reclaim.
//     Covers the daemon-alive gossip-partition case. DOCUMENTED GAPS (per plan, tied to
//     later phases): automatic majority reclaim across an UNREACHABLE holder needs a
//     real fence proof OR a verified absence proof (later phases) — until then it's an
//     intentional availability degradation (VIP down + alert), and a data-plane-only
//     partition (gRPC/gossip healthy but VRRP split) needs a VIP-conflict detector
//     (Phase-6 follow-up).
//
// Advertising is done for all implemented tokens; ENABLING each (setting its config
// flag in prod) is the staged step, gated per token on its own ephemeral-partition
// validation. Once advertised, enforcement activates only after EVERY
// enforcement-relevant member advertises it (fresh Ping), it latches, AND the config
// flag is on.
// OPERATOR NOTE: with the gate enforced, a 2-worker cluster with NO witness refuses
// automated failover (even-worker + no-witness blocks HA — deliberate); add a witness or
// accept the trade-off. Validate on an ephemeral partition before flipping in prod.
//
// DE-ADVERTISING IS NOT A KILL SWITCH once a node has latched. Removing the token
// from `supported` stops NEW activation, but Enforced() first honors the durable
// per-token marker (<dataDir>/split_brain_activated.<token>) and returns true from
// it before consulting current advertised support — the whole point of the
// fail-closed latch (a partition mustn't silently re-open the legacy path).
//
// KILL SWITCH (the modern way — DO NOT delete marker files): every flippable token
// EXCEPT split_brain_gate_v1 is gated `configFlag && Enforced/Latched` at its
// decision site (auth.strict_mtls_identity/forwarded_identity, and
// enforcement.{safe_fence_default,lww_skew_guard,vip_self_demote,vip_proof_reclaim}).
// The config flag is authoritative for enforcement AND recovery: set it false +
// restart and enforcement stops regardless of the latch marker. Deleting a marker
// file to "stand down" is retired — it confuses the state machine (the HA monitor
// re-establishes the latch while the flag is on and the cluster is healthy). Only
// split_brain_gate_v1 has no config flag; for it, marker deletion remains the sole
// stand-down (it flips via `supported` alone).
