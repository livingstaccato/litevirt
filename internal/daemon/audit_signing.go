// A head is what makes a truncated tail detectable, so the interval bounds how

//
// Every audit write path in the daemon goes through corrosion.InsertAuditLog on
// d.db, and InsertAuditLog signs with whatever keyring that client holds. So
// this one call is what decides whether the RPC handlers, the failover
// coordinator, the health owner-asserts and the pending-audit fold write signed
// rows; none of them can opt out, and none needs to opt in. It must run before
// any of them starts, which is why Run calls it before building them.
//
// Signing is on unless enforcement.audit_signature is explicitly false (see
// LoadConfig). The signing key IS the host's cluster key: already CA-signed with
// this host's name as its CN, already present on every node, and already the
// credential that says "I am this host". Minting a separate one would need the
// CA private key, which lives only on whichever node ran `lv host init`, so a
// fresh node could not sign its own log at all.
//
// Wire the keyring NOW — rows get written during startup and must be signed —
// but do NOT record any lifecycle fact yet. Adoption boundaries and retirement
