// Audit signing key rotation.
//
// Rotation exists because a key can leak — and one did: `lv host init
// root@<host>` shipped /etc/litevirt/pki/host.key mode 0644 on every node it
// provisioned, so anyone with a local shell could take a copy. Tightening the
// mode does not undo a copy already made, which is precisely when an operator
// needs to be able to replace the key.
//
// WHAT ROTATION HAS TO ACHIEVE, and what it cannot.
//
// Someone holding the old private key can produce a valid signature over any
// content they like, including a row timestamped before the rotation. So a
// rule like "reject rows signed by the old key after time T" proves nothing:
// the attacker chooses the timestamp and signs it. Comparing timestamps is
// theatre against exactly the adversary rotation is for.
//
// What genuinely constrains them is the CHAIN, and one new fact anchored to the
// NEW key. Rotation publishes a chain head — signed with the new key, over the
// whole existing log — which states "at sequence S this host's chain hashed to
// X". From that moment, altering ANY row at or before S changes the chain and
// contradicts a head the attacker cannot forge, because forging it needs the
// new key they do not have. The old key's entire history is sealed by a
// signature made with its successor.
//
// That is the honest boundary: rows the old key wrote are frozen at rotation,
// and rows written after it need the new key. What rotation cannot do is
// retroactively protect a log that was already forged before anyone noticed —
// no scheme can, and claiming otherwise would be worse than saying so.
//
// The retirement record catches the naive case on top of that: continued use of
// the old key past its boundary, which is what happens when rotation is done but
// the old key is still installed somewhere.
//
// A retirement is itself SIGNED (audit_key_lifecycle, v47). It has to be. It
// began as two mutable columns on audit_signing_keys, and as plain replicated
// data those were writable by anyone: forging a retirement put every row a host
// had ever signed past a boundary on every node at once, with no way back, and
// clearing a genuine one was equally free. The detector for "somebody else has
// this key" cannot itself be something somebody else can write.

// ActiveAuditKeyID returns the key id a host is currently signing with — its
// one published key with no verified retirement. ok is false when the host has
// no signing contract: it has never published, or every key it published has
// been retired.
//
// This is the predicate the verifier's whole unsigned-row rule rests on, so it
// reads retirement through auditKeyRetirements (signatures checked) rather than
// from a column anyone can write.

//
// Publishing a signing certificate IS the contract: a replicated, CA-signed,
// per-host declaration that this host's rows carry a signature from here on.
// Nothing but a signed retirement takes it back.
//
// The START matters as much as the fact. A certificate says a host commits, not
// WHEN — and without the when, publishing one retroactively claims every row the
// host ever wrote, so the first verify after enabling signing reports a cluster's
// entire history as tampering. That is the fastest possible way to teach an
// operator to ignore this command. The signed 'adopted' record supplies it, and a
// certificate WITHOUT one is not a contract at all — see the !adopted branch below.
//
// This is deliberately a fact about replicated state rather than about a node's
// own config or its own log:
//
//   - A node-local flag would let a compromised node declare itself exempt and
//     report its log clean, and peers disagreeing about the same rows destroys
//     the only mechanism that makes cross-node verification worth anything.
//   - The host's own history — "has it signed before?" — is walked in an order
//     the attacker chooses, and says nothing at all about a host that has never
//     managed to sign, which is precisely the interesting case.
//
// It is per host, so a gradual rollout cannot false-fire: a host that has not
// published yet is simply pre-enforcement.
//
// The second return value is the one that closes a false NEGATIVE, and it is the
// half a rule keyed only on adoption cannot express. setupAuditSigning publishes a
// host's certificate even when its private key cannot be read, on the stated
// grounds that publishing nothing is the worst outcome — the host then "looks like
// one that was never meant to sign, so its entire audit log reads as ordinary
// pre-enforcement history", and "the key is unreadable is precisely the state an
// attacker arranges, so it must not be the state that goes unnoticed".
//
// Requiring an adoption record for a contract made that comment false. A host that
// cannot read its key cannot SIGN an adoption record either — writeAuditLifecycle
// refuses without a signing key — so the cert-only path put nobody under contract
// and the attacker's state became the silent one. Verified: three unsigned rows
// from a host with a published certificate returned Tampered=false.
//
// Reporting the certificate rather than resurrecting a contract is what keeps both
// halves. A contract needs a START, and guessing "from row 0" is what condemned a
// cluster's entire pre-enforcement history — 659 legacy rows per node on the lab.
// This needs no start: it says the host declared it signs and demonstrably cannot,

// reduceLifecycle applies the signer-standing rule and folds the survivors.
//
// The missing rule, and the worst hole on this branch: a record was admitted if its
// signature verified and the SUBJECT key belonged to the host. Nothing asked whether
// the SIGNER still had standing — and certFor deliberately keeps retired
// certificates resolvable, so a key that had already been rotated out and retired
// still verified. A leaked key could therefore sign a retirement for its own
// SUCCESSOR: the host then stopped signing (setupAuditSigning refuses a retired
// key), left every signing contract, and `lv audit verify` reported the log CLEAN
// while its rows were unsigned and freely rewritable. Unrecoverable — rotating again
// just produced another successor to retire, retirements are append-only, and the
// earliest one wins. Reproduced before fixing.
//
// Standing has exactly two sources:
//
//   - the key ITSELF (by_key_id == key_id) — a voluntary stop, and the shape a
//     rotation's own adoption always takes;
//   - the CLUSTER CA (by_key_id == auditCASigner) — the operator, speaking for a
//     host that cannot speak for itself, which is precisely what holding ca.key
//     authorises. Producing that signature requires the CA private key, which lives
//     in the operator's config directory and on no node.
//
// An earlier attempt ordered standing by adoption sequence — "only a key adopted
// later may retire you". It is unsound twice over: adoption takes the LATEST record,
// so a key's holder can inflate their own adoption at will, and on a quiet host a
// rotation adopts the new key at the same sequence as the old one, so the two cannot
// be ordered at all. Neither problem exists once the CA says so directly.
