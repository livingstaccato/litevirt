// TestCheckHost_RefreshesASteadilyHealthyRow is the #196 regression.
//
// checkHost wrote a host_health row ONLY on transition. A peer that fails keeps
// changing — consecutive_failures increments every probe — so the failing
// direction is always fresh. A peer that is steadily healthy changes nothing
// after the first probe, so its row is written once and then never again.
//
// failover.recoverHosts counts healthy observers with updated_at newer than
// healthFreshness (30 s). Nothing refreshes a healthy row inside that window,
// so the count it sees is normally zero and a host in 'offline'/'fenced' can
// only recover if recoverHosts happens to run in the 30 s after the transition
// — which recentlyFenced's 5-minute suppression guarantees it does not. The
// host then stays offline until a manual `lv host undrain`.
//
// Measured on the lab (kvm003, four healthy nodes, 2026-09-20T19:47:46Z): every
// healthy row was stamped 19:43:0xZ, 4m42s old, while the suspect rows for the
