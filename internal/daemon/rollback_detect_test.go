// A node that latched a capability token and is then rolled back to a binary
// predating that token has no way to notice.
//
// The durable activation markers are one file per token, and they are loaded by
// iterating capabilities.All() — the token list COMPILED INTO THE RUNNING BINARY —
// and Stat'ing each expected path. Nothing scans the directory. So a rolled-back
// binary has no "latched_hardware_v2" string to look for, never looks, and starts
// clean. There is no cluster-side record either: capabilities travel only in a
// live PingResponse, and no schema column holds them. The schema version is the
// one durable signal, and it is deliberately tolerated so that a schema bump stays
// reversible and a mixed-version rolling upgrade keeps working — so it must not be
// used for this.
//
// The detection therefore has to be the one place that reads the marker DIRECTORY
// rather than the token list: a marker whose token this build has never heard of
// is proof that a newer binary ran here and latched something.
