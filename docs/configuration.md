# Configuration

The daemon reads its config from `/etc/litevirt/config.yaml` (override with `LITEVIRT_CONFIG` env var).

# Address the web UI listens on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)

# a reverse proxy that terminates TLS.
ui_bind: "127.0.0.1"

# Address peers reach this host on. Sets BOTH the gossip advertise address and

# address the host certificate does not cover and every replication push fails
# the TLS hostname check.
#
# Empty (default) auto-detects, which is only safe on an unambiguously
# single-homed host: the host record takes the source IP toward the DEFAULT
# ROUTE, while gossip takes the first private IP by INTERFACE ENUMERATION ORDER.
# Those are different heuristics and can pick different interfaces.
#
# SET THIS on any host with more than one network — a separate management NIC, a
# NAT'd or container fabric, a storage network. The failure is quiet and
# confusing when the auto-detected address is identical on every node (e.g. a
# NAT'd 10.0.2.15): gossip membership looks healthy and every node lists its
# peers by name, but each one dials ITSELF, so the cluster never converges and
# the logs show "certificate is valid for <real ip>, not <wrong ip>".

# MUST be a bare IPv4 literal — no port, no brackets, no hostname. The daemon
# refuses to start otherwise. IPv6 is rejected because cluster transport is
# IPv4-only today: gossip and gRPC both bind 0.0.0.0. Nothing downstream would
# catch a v6 value — memberlist accepts it and gossips it over the v4-only mesh,
# so the node boots looking healthy, no peer can reach it, and the failure
# detector marks it suspect and fences a host that was never down.

```

## Minimal config

For a single-host setup, only `host_name` is required:

```yaml
host_name: "host-a"
```

All other fields use sensible defaults.

## Joining a cluster

Every host after the first needs `join_peers` pointing to at least one existing host:

```yaml
host_name: "host-b"
join_peers:
  - "10.0.50.10:7946"
```

Multiple peers can be listed for redundancy. The membership protocol discovers the remaining cluster members automatically, and state replication streams mutations to all peers via gRPC.

## Image-pull controls

URL-based image pulls (`lv image pull <url>`) are bounded by `max_image_bytes`
and `image_pull_timeout_sec`, plus an OPT-IN SSRF network deny policy
(`image_pull_block_metadata` / `image_pull_block_private` / `image_pull_blocked_cidrs`)
— all in the reference above. A pull's RESOLVED destination IP is rejected at
connect time if it falls in a blocked range, checked on every connection, so it is
DNS-rebinding- and redirect-safe. Notes:

- **Opt-in.** With no policy set (the default) pulls are unrestricted and honor
  `HTTP(S)_PROXY`. Recommended on cloud hosts: set `image_pull_block_metadata: true`
  so a hostile image URL can't reach the instance-metadata endpoint.
- **Direct-only when a policy is set.** Enabling any deny policy disables proxy use
  for pulls (a proxied request can't be validated against the post-proxy target);
  connections go direct so the resolved IP is always inspectable.
- **Scope.** The deny policy applies to **URL pulls only**. `lv image import` /
  `push` are streamed over gRPC (no outbound fetch) and are bounded only by
  `max_image_bytes`.
- An invalid CIDR in `image_pull_blocked_cidrs` **fails daemon startup** (a
  configured security policy is never silently dropped).

## Garbage collection

Re-enrolling 2FA recovery codes and recreating load balancers leave behind rows
that can never validate or render again (superseded recovery-code sets, stale LB
backend generations). An hourly per-node sweep hard-deletes them once they age
past a retention floor (`tombstone_gc_retention_hours` /
`tombstone_gc_orphan_retention_hours` in the reference above); the count is exported
as `litevirt_gc_rows_deleted_total` (labeled by `table`).

The same hourly sweep retires admission authority still held by projects that no
longer exist, and expires capacity leases abandoned by a crash between reserve and
release. Both are reported in the journal when they find anything.

The sweep is local-only and deterministic (each node prunes its own copy; it
never touches a current-active-set or current-generation row), so it is safe on a
live cluster.

### Signals the daemon ignores

The daemon deliberately does not terminate on `SIGHUP` or `SIGPIPE`, and does not
treat `SIGHUP` as a config reload. systemd counts death by either as a *clean*
exit, so a `SIGHUP` from `needrestart` or `unattended-upgrades` would leave the
node down with the unit reporting success. Each ignored signal is logged and
counted as `litevirt_signal_ignored_total` (labeled by `signal`) — a rising count
means something on the host keeps trying to bounce the orchestrator, which is
worth chasing even though the daemon now survives it.

## Capacity and overcommit

How much of a host litevirt is willing to hand to workloads. Cluster-wide
defaults live here; per-host overrides (`lv host config --cpu-overcommit …`) win
where set.

```yaml
capacity:
  cpu_overcommit_ratio: 4.0        # default 4.0
  mem_overcommit_ratio: 1.0        # default 1.0
  host_cpu_reserve: 1              # default 1
  host_memory_reserve_mib: 1024    # default 1024
  host_memory_reserve_pct: 5       # default 5
  vm_memory_overhead_mib: 128      # default 128
  disk_overcommit_ratio: 3.0       # default 3.0
  pool_reserve_pct: 5              # default 5
```

**CPU and memory are deliberately different.** vCPU is time-sliced: running more
vCPUs than cores is normal and the guests simply share, so the default
oversubscribes 4×. Memory is not — without ballooning, KSM or swap a guest's RAM
is either backed or the kernel starts reclaiming — so `mem_overcommit_ratio`
defaults to exactly `1.0`. Raise it only where something makes the promise real.

**The reserve matters more than either ratio.** At ratio 1.0 with no reserve,
guests are offered 100% of RAM and nothing is left for the kernel, page cache,
qemu's per-VM overhead or litevirtd itself — the host thrashes and, in the case
that prompted this, stops answering SSH. The effective memory reserve is the
**larger** of `host_memory_reserve_mib` and `host_memory_reserve_pct`, so the
fixed floor protects small nodes while the percentage scales with large ones.

`vm_memory_overhead_mib` is charged per running VM on top of its configured
memory, covering qemu's own footprint (device models, video, page tables).
Ignoring it under-counts usage, and by more the denser the host.

**Disk is admitted per POOL, not per host.** `hosts.disk_total` is the wrong
denominator for anything shared — a Ceph or NFS pool's capacity has nothing to do
with the host's local disk — while every managed pool carries its own
statfs-sampled total and used. A new disk is charged against its pool's **actual**
free space, less `pool_reserve_pct`, after dividing the declared size by
`disk_overcommit_ratio`.

That ratio defaults above 1 for the opposite reason memory's defaults to exactly
1: thin provisioning is the norm, so a declared 100 GiB qcow2 may occupy 2 GiB,
and charging it in full against real free space would refuse ordinary practice.
Both knobs count what is really taken.

A pool with **no capacity sample** (total 0 — never sampled, or a driver that
reports nothing) is treated as UNKNOWN and skipped, never as full. Refusing on
missing telemetry would break every cluster whose pools have not been sampled yet.

**Containers count too, for memory.** A running container's memory cap is
subtracted from host capacity exactly like a VM's, and `lv ct create` / `lv ct
start` are admitted against it. Container CPU is *not* counted: `--cpu` on a
container is cgroup **shares** — a relative weight, not a vCPU reservation — so
adding it to a vCPU total would be meaningless. An **uncapped** container
(`--memory 0`) is not accounted at all: litevirt knows the cap, not the
footprint. Cap your containers if you want them to count.

These apply to **both** placement and admission — VM create (including a pinned
`--host`) and live resize all consult the same numbers, so the scheduler and the
admission check cannot disagree.

Admission runs wherever a host's usage can GROW: VM **create**, **start**, live
**resize**, and a `--restart-if-needed` **reconfigure** that grows the VM. Usage
counts running VMs, so a stopped VM consumes nothing until it starts — checking
only at create time would be sidestepped by creating VMs that each fit and then
starting them all. A shrink never consumes anything and is never refused.
Automated recovery is deliberately exempt: the failover/reconciler restart paths
are not admitted, because after a host reboot every VM starts at once and
refusing there would strand the ones that lost the race.

To exceed the policy deliberately for one VM, pass `--allow-overcommit` to
`lv run` or `lv start`; the host check is skipped (project quota still applies)
and the bypass is audited.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LITEVIRT_CONFIG` | Override config file path |
| `LV_CONFIG_DIR` | CLI: override the per-user config directory (default `~/.config/litevirt`; holds the CLI cert and stored login credential) |
| `LV_HOST` | CLI: default remote gRPC/mTLS target (`host` or `host:port`; a legacy `user@host` prefix is ignored) |
| `LV_TOKEN` | CLI: bearer token to authenticate gRPC calls. Overrides the credential stored by `lv login`. |
| `LITEVIRT_UNSAFE_NO_KILLMODE_CHECK` | Skip startup `KillMode=process` self-check (development / non-systemd hosts only). Default check protects against unit-file regressions that would kill child QEMU processes on daemon stop. |
| `LITEVIRT_UNSAFE_SKIP_ROLLBACK_CHECK` | Skip the startup capability-rollback self-check. That check looks for durable activation markers naming tokens this binary has never heard of — proof a newer binary ran here — and puts the node under WAL quarantine: it stays up and reachable but emits no replicated writes and advertises no capabilities, so peers see it degraded and nothing new latches across it. Set this only after reseeding the node's state, or to start a rolled-back binary deliberately. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_ENDPOINT` | Telemetry: OTLP endpoint; turns logs+traces export on. Overrides `telemetry.otlp_endpoint`. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_HEADERS` | Telemetry: OTLP headers, e.g. `Authorization=Basic <b64>` (collector auth — keep in env, not the config file). |
| `LITEVIRT_LOG_LEVEL` | Telemetry: log level `TRACE`\|`DEBUG`\|`INFO`\|`WARNING`\|`ERROR`\|`CRITICAL`. |
| `LITEVIRT_LOG_FORMAT` | Telemetry: log format `json`\|`console`\|`pretty`. |
| `LITEVIRT_TELEMETRY_ENV` / `LITEVIRT_TELEMETRY_SERVICE` / `LITEVIRT_TELEMETRY_VERSION` | Telemetry: `service.env` / `service.name` / `service.version` labels. |
| `LITEVIRT_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Telemetry: trace sample rate `0.0`–`1.0`. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_TIMEOUT` / `LITEVIRT_OTEL_RETRIES` / `LITEVIRT_OTEL_BACKOFF` | Telemetry exporter resilience (seconds / count / seconds): bound the OTLP export calls so a slow collector can't stall the daemon. Fan out to logs + traces. Off by default. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_FAIL_OPEN` | Telemetry: drop on export failure instead of blocking (`true`/`false`). Fans out to logs + traces. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | Telemetry: drain cap (seconds) on daemon stop; logs signal only. |
