// Delegated project-quota admission counting (F2 second half).
//
// Routing every project admission through one decider closes the race between two
// IN-FLIGHT reservations: the holder's own replica necessarily contains every grant
// it has made, so a second request cannot miss the first.
//
// It does NOT, by itself, close the window that opens once a grant is released. The
// winner commits its VM row on ITS node and only then releases the lease; the holder
// learns of that row when replication delivers it. Between those two moments the
// holder's committed-usage sum is short by exactly one admission — so a second
// request arriving in that gap sees quota that is already spent.
//
// So a released lease keeps counting until the resource it admitted is actually
// VISIBLE here. Each lease records what it was about to create, and the check is
// simply "can I see that row yet?" — if yes, committed usage already counts it and
// the lease must not be counted again; if no, the lease stands in for it.
//
// That self-cancelling condition matters more than it looks. A blind timer instead of
// a visibility check double-counts every admission for the length of the timer, which
// makes ordinary SEQUENTIAL creates on the holder fail — the first version of this did
// exactly that, and a fleet scenario caught it.
//
// The grace remains only as a BACKSTOP, for a lease whose resource never appears at
// all (the admission was granted but the create failed downstream). Those hold quota
// briefly and then stop.

// stampedStep is an operation step with the wall-clock time it was appended — the
// step reducer needs only names, but the settle grace needs to know how long ago a
// lease was released.

//     our own must not be subtracted from the headroom we compare against).
//   - CAPACITY leases that reached a terminal step within `grace` AND whose admitted
//     resource is not yet visible here, at ANY id — winners that are committing right
//     now. Id order is irrelevant for these: they are no longer racing us, they are a
//     decided fact this node cannot see yet.
//
// grace ≤ 0 disables the settle term, leaving pure earlier-claimant counting.
