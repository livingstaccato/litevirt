// HostRotateAuditKey installs a fresh audit signing pair on one host and
// restarts its daemon.
//
// There is no rotate RPC and none is needed. A host is the only party that
// holds its new private key, so it is the only one that can sign the chain head
// that seals what the old key wrote; the daemon does that itself on the next
// start (corrosion.AdoptAuditKey). This command's whole job is to put
// audit-signing.crt/.key in place and bounce the unit.
//
// It deliberately does NOT touch host.crt/host.key, even though those are what
// an un-rotated host signs with. Three things read the TLS identity and none of
// them would notice a swap: the daemon builds its gRPC serving TLS config once
// at boot (internal/daemon/daemon.go), the health checker caches the client
// config it dials peers with (internal/health/checker.go), and
// internal/pki/libvirt.go symlinks /etc/pki/libvirt/{server,client}{cert,key}.pem
// at those files, which qemu+tls:// follows mid-migration. Replacing the TLS
// identity of a running node is a much larger operation — an operator restoring
// audit integrity must not be gambling with quorum or a live migration.

// auditRotationSettleHint is how long the target's daemon waits for replication
// before recording the rotation. Kept in step with daemon.auditLifecycleSettle by
// TestRotationSettleHintMatchesTheDaemon.
