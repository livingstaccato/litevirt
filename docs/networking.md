# Networking

litevirt attaches VMs to Linux bridges on the host. It does not manage the physical network fabric — your switches, routers, and underlay are your responsibility.

## Network types

### Bridge (default)

Attaches VMs directly to a Linux bridge. The simplest option for flat datacenter networks.

```yaml
networks:
  lan:
    type: "bridge"
    interface: "br0"
```

litevirt auto-creates the bridge if it doesn't already exist. If you need to attach a physical uplink, create the bridge manually beforehand:

```bash
ip link add br0 type bridge
ip link set br0 up
ip link set eth0 master br0    # attach uplink
```

### VXLAN

Creates overlay networks between hosts using VXLAN encapsulation. Useful when you need L2 connectivity across L3 boundaries.

```yaml
networks:
  overlay:
    type: "vxlan"
    vni: 1000
    underlay: "eth0"
    port: 4789
    subnet: "10.10.0.0/24"
    dhcp: true
```

litevirt manages VTEP configuration and FDB entries. BGP peering between hosts distributes MAC/IP mappings.

### Isolated

A host-local bridge with no external connectivity. VMs on the same host can communicate, but there is no path to the outside.

```yaml
networks:
  internal:
    type: "isolated"
    subnet: "172.16.0.0/24"
    dhcp: true
```

The host bridge for an isolated network is `br-iso-<name>`; when that would
exceed Linux's 15-char interface-name limit it is automatically shortened to a
stable hashed form, so network names of any length work.

### SR-IOV

Passes a virtual function (VF) from an SR-IOV-capable NIC directly to the VM for near-native network performance.

```yaml
networks:
  fast:
    type: "sriov"
    pf: "eth1"
    spoof-check: true
```

Requires:

- IOMMU enabled in BIOS and kernel (`intel_iommu=on` or `amd_iommu=on`)
- SR-IOV capable NIC with VFs created
- `vfio-pci` kernel module loaded

### Direct (macvtap)

Attaches VMs directly to a host interface using macvtap, without creating a bridge. This is useful when the host interface carries the host's management IP (e.g., a VLAN sub-interface) and enslaving it to a bridge would disrupt connectivity.

```yaml
networks:
  mgmt:
    type: "direct"
    interface: "bond0.206"
```

The VM gets L2 access to the same network as the parent interface. No bridge, DHCP, or NAT is created by litevirt — the interface must already exist on the host.

When to use direct mode:

- **Management VLANs** — the host IP lives on a VLAN interface (e.g., `bond0.206`) and moving it to a bridge is impractical or risky.
- **Simple flat attachment** — you just need VMs on the same L2 segment as the host, with no overlay or isolation.

Limitations:

- **No VM-to-host communication** — macvtap in bridge mode does not allow the guest to reach the host's IP on the parent interface. This is a kernel-level restriction of macvtap. VMs can reach other devices on the network, but not the hypervisor itself via that interface.
- **No DHCP from litevirt** — IP assignment must come from an external DHCP server or be configured statically via cloud-init.
- **Interface must exist** — litevirt does not create the parent interface. It must be present on the host before deployment.

## VM network attachment

```yaml
vms:
  web:
    network:
      - name: "lan"
        model: "virtio"           # virtio (default) or e1000
        ip: "10.0.1.50"           # optional, DHCP if omitted
        mac: "52:54:00:ab:cd:ef"  # optional, auto-generated if omitted
        gateway: "10.0.1.1"       # optional
```

Multiple networks can be attached to a single VM:

```yaml
    network:
      - name: "frontend"
      - name: "backend"
        ip: "172.16.0.10"
```

## Container network attachment

Containers attach to the same logical networks as VMs and reach parity on the
managed path. A *managed* NIC (`network=<name>` on the CLI, or a compose `kind:
lxc` workload's `network:`) gets a tracked `container_interfaces` row, a
deterministic host veth + locally-administered MAC, an IPAM lease, a DNS record,
and per-NIC security-group enforcement on its veth. A *raw* NIC (`bridge=<br>`)
attaches straight onto a host bridge with no managed state (the admin escape
hatch).

```bash
lv ct create web --network network=app-net,name=eth0,security-groups=web;db
```

Bridge-family networks (bridge / vxlan / isolated) are supported; `direct` and
`sriov` are VM-only. See [containers.md](containers.md) for the full container
networking model.

## Network ownership (project isolation)

A network is either **global** (the default — usable by every project) or **owned
by a project**:

```bash
lv network create app-net --type bridge --project acme   # owned + isolated
lv network create mgmt --type bridge                     # global (shared)
```

A workload may attach only to a global network or one its own project owns;
attaching to another project's network is denied at create/attach time. A raw
bridge is outside isolation, so it requires cluster-root authority (a project
workload must use a managed network). See [tenancy.md](tenancy.md).

## VLAN trunk mode

For VMs that need to handle multiple VLANs (e.g., virtual routers):

```yaml
    network:
      - name: "trunk-port"
        trunk: [100, 101, 200]
```

## VM IP addressing

How a VM gets its address depends on when and how you set it:

- **Static IP at create.** Set a per-NIC IP (and optional gateway) when creating the VM. For a cloud image, litevirt writes a cloud-init NoCloud `network-config` (attached as a read-only cdrom) so the guest applies the static address at first boot. This requires a cloud-init-capable guest image; it is not applied to images that do not run cloud-init.
- **DHCP.** Leave the IP blank to use the network's addressing. On a DHCP-enabled managed network the guest gets a dynamic lease; litevirt then observes the address (ARP / DHCP leases) and records it back for display.
- **Recorded (post-create) IP.** `lv config <vm> --ip <ip>` records the IP in inventory and, when a DNS domain is configured, makes a best-effort attempt to publish a DNS record (a DNS failure is logged, not fatal). It does **not** reconfigure a running guest, take a DHCP reservation, or change the guest's actual address — to change a running VM's IP, reconfigure it in the guest (or recreate it with the desired static IP).

```yaml
# Static IP at create (cloud image), via the compose spec or the web UI:
    network:
      - name: "lan"
        ip: "10.0.1.50"       # optional: gateway, ipv6
```

```bash
# Record an IP for an existing VM (inventory / DNS only — does not touch the guest):
lv config my-vm --ip 10.0.1.50 --network lan
```

## NAT

By default, litevirt enables IP masquerading (NAT) for networks with a subnet defined. This gives VMs outbound internet access through the host.

To disable NAT on a network:

```yaml
networks:
  internal:
    type: "bridge"
    interface: "br-internal"
    subnet: "10.0.5.0/24"
    dhcp: true
    nat: false
```

NAT is ignored on isolated networks (no uplink) and on host-isolated networks (use `snat: true` on a load balancer instead — see [compose.md](compose.md#snat-via-vip)).

## IPv6

Network subnets accept IPv6 CIDRs. The IPAM allocator, dnsmasq DHCP/RA
configuration, and cloud-init network-config all handle v4 and v6
identically:

```yaml
networks:
  v6lan:
    type: "bridge"
    interface: "br0"
    subnet: "2001:db8:1::/64"
    dhcp: true     # enables DHCPv6 + Router Advertisements via dnsmasq
```

Notes:

- For v6, the gateway is `<network>::1` (e.g., `2001:db8:1::1`) and IP
  allocation starts at `<network>::2`. Up to 65 535 host addresses are
  enumerable per subnet (caps the IPAM scan; SLAAC-only deployments
  bypass this entirely).
- When `dhcp: true` on a v6 subnet, dnsmasq runs with `--enable-ra` so
  SLAAC-only guests still get a default route.
- VMs can have static v6 addresses via `ip:` on the network attachment
  (cloud-init network-config v1 handles them as `address: 2001:db8::42/64`),
  or via the dedicated `ipv6:` / `ipv6-gateway:` fields when running dual-stack
  alongside a v4 `ip:`:

  ```yaml
      network:
        - name: "v6lan"
          ip: "10.0.1.50"
          gateway: "10.0.1.1"
          ipv6: "2001:db8:1::42"
          ipv6-gateway: "2001:db8:1::1"
  ```

  An empty `ipv6:` falls back to SLAAC / DHCPv6 if the network is configured
  for it.
- Mixed dual-stack works: declare both v4 and v6 subnets on the same
  bridge if your guest expects both.

## DNS

litevirt runs a lightweight DNS server (default port 5354) that resolves VM **and managed-container** names to IP addresses. Records are created and removed automatically as workloads get an IP, move, or are deleted.

Name format: `<name>.<stack>.<domain>` in a stack, or `<name>.<domain>` standalone — the same namespace for VMs and containers. For example, with the default domain `litevirt.local`, `web-1` in the `myapp` stack resolves as `web-1.myapp.litevirt.local`. A managed container's record is maintained by the per-host IP scanner (which discovers a DHCP address, persists it, and writes the record); a migrate re-creates it on the target.

Configure the domain in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
dns_domain: "litevirt.local"
dns_port: 5354
```

## Security groups

Security groups **are implemented and enforced.** They provide per-VM
firewall rules via nftables, applied by the per-host firewall reconciler
that polls cluster state every 30 s. See [firewall.md](firewall.md) for
the full three-tier model (cluster / host / VM), the `lv sg` CLI, and
the AWS/GCP/Proxmox direction semantics.

Compose syntax (top-level `security-groups:`, referenced per-NIC):

```yaml
security-groups:
  web-sg:
    rules:
      - direction: "ingress"
        proto: "tcp"
        port: "80"
        cidr: "0.0.0.0/0"
        action: "accept"
      - direction: "ingress"
        proto: "tcp"
        port: "22"
        cidr: "10.0.0.0/8"
        action: "accept"

vms:
  web:
    network:
      - name: "lan"
        security-groups: [web-sg]
```

## Host network configuration

`lv host network` manages the **host's own wiring** — bridges, bonds (including
LACP), VLAN interfaces, and physical-NIC addressing — the layer underneath the
managed VM networks above. Intent is recorded per host and rendered by that
host into a single litevirt-owned netplan file (`/etc/netplan/90-litevirt.yaml`);
litevirt never edits any other netplan file, and refuses to manage an interface
another file already defines.

The flow is deliberately two-step — record, then apply behind a rollback:

```bash
# Record intent: a bridge over eth1 with a static address.
lv host network set vmbr0 --host node-2 --kind bridge --member eth1 \
    --address 10.0.10.2/24 --gateway 10.0.10.1 --nameserver 10.0.10.1

# An LACP bond and a VLAN on top of it.
lv host network set bond0 --host node-2 --kind bond --member eth2 --member eth3 \
    --bond-mode 802.3ad --lacp-rate fast --hash-policy layer3+4 --mtu 9000
lv host network set vlan40 --host node-2 --kind vlan --vlan-link bond0 --vlan-id 40 --dhcp4

# See exactly what would change on the host (writes nothing).
lv host network plan --host node-2

# Apply behind the timed rollback.
lv host network apply --host node-2

lv host network ls --host node-2
lv host network rm vlan40 --host node-2   # takes effect on the next apply
```

`apply` runs `netplan try`: the change is reverted — kernel-side, even if the
daemon dies mid-window — unless the host confirms its own connectivity
(advertise address still assigned, its own gRPC listener answering, and the
prior default gateway still reachable). A failed confirm restores the previous
file and records the intent as `rolled_back` with the cause, visible
cluster-wide in `lv host network ls`.

A plan that would touch the interface carrying the **cluster LAN** —
reconfiguring it, enslaving it into a bridge/bond, or moving the advertise
address — is refused unless you name that interface with
`--force-interface <iface>` (the name is shown by `plan`). Naming it is the
confirmation that you understand you may be disconnecting the node.

Removal is two-step as well: `rm` tombstones the intent, and the next `apply`
renders the file without it. Note netplan does not delete an existing virtual
device when its definition disappears: the interface stays up (unconfigured)
until the next reboot, or until the operator removes it with `ip link del`.
The persistent config is gone either way — it will not return after a reboot.
