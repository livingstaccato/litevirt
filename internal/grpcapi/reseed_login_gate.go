// preSessionAuthMethods are the skipAuth entries that AUTHENTICATE a caller —
// the ones that take a credential and hand back a session. They bypass the
// interceptor because the caller has no bearer yet, which is correct and also
// means they are the only RPCs that can be reached on a node whose secret
// state is incomplete.
//
// Ping, Ready and ListRealms are deliberately NOT here. Ping is how an operator
// and every peer diagnose this node, and the reseed path itself calls it;
// gating it would hide the very condition the marker records and break the
// recovery it points at. Ready is the same argument one step further: it exists
// to answer "can this daemon serve", a node mid-reseed cannot, and refusing the
// question would make that node indistinguishable from an unreachable one —
// which is the exact conflation Ready was added to end.

// admitPreSessionCredentialExchange decides, from ONE reading of the fence,
// whether a pre-session credential exchange may proceed — and stamps that same
// reading onto the context for the mint to compare against.
//
// One reading, not two, and that is the whole point. The refusal used to read
// the marker and the stamp used to read the generation separately; a reseed
// landing between the two made the stamp capture the POST-reseed generation, so
// the comparison at mintSession found no change. If the reseed had also
// finished by then, `incomplete` was clear again and a 2FA-enrolled account got
// a password-only session — the very race the generation was added to close,
// one layer in. Two reads cannot be ordered into safety; there has to be a
// single observation both halves derive from.
//
// The window this guards is real: a reseed discards the sensitive tables and
// restores them in a LATER step than users and their password hashes, and
// LocalRealm.Authenticate derives Requires2FA from len(factors) > 0, so an empty
// user_2fa reads as "nobody enrolled".
//
// An unreadable fence REFUSES. Returning the context unstamped instead left the
// mint unable to tell "the stamp was dropped" from "this did not come through
// the gate", so it skipped the comparison and fell back to the boolean the
// generation exists precisely because it is insufficient — a transient
// SQLITE_BUSY at the door reopening the whole hole.
//
// Ping and ListRealms are not gated: Ping is how this condition is diagnosed and
// the reseed path itself calls it, so gating it would hide the fault and break
// the recovery it points at.
