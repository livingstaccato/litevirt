// D1 — project-admission authority. Project quota is a HARD admission guarantee, so
// one deterministic holder per NORMALIZED project serializes it. Authority is
// STICKY: the initial holder is minted once; it does not move merely because
// membership changes. A PLANNED handoff records an explicit transfer; an UNPLANNED
// takeover requires PROOF-GRADE fencing of the prior holder (a fence_proof_ref).
// Every transfer mints a monotonic authority_epoch; admission accepts reservations
// only from the CURRENT epoch, so a stale ex-holder's writes are rejected.

// ErrFenceProofRequired is returned when an unplanned ("fenced") takeover is
// attempted without a proof reference for the prior holder's fence.

// DeriveProjectAuthorityHolder picks a project's INITIAL authority holder from the

//
// Every node claiming authority for ITSELF looks reasonable and is useless: each node
// serves its own creates, so each becomes the holder of its own replica, every
// admission stays local, and delegation never happens. Worse, the claims then collide
// — one epoch, two holders — and the cluster is back to two deciders while believing
// it has one. That is not a hypothetical: the lab produced exactly it, with node-1 and
// node-2 each holding /qa at epoch 1.
//
// Choosing by hash of the project name over the SORTED host list makes concurrent
// claimants mint an IDENTICAL row instead of competing ones, so the race stops
// mattering: the rows converge because they agree. It also spreads different projects
// across different hosts rather than piling every project onto one.
//
// Membership is itself eventually consistent, so two nodes with different views of the
// host list can still choose differently. That window is far narrower than claiming for
// self (which collides every single time) and heals the same way — the losing claim's
// node sees FailedPrecondition and retries against the winner.
