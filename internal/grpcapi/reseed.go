// question here: reseed is about which build generation the state comes from.

// Capability sets are deliberately NOT compared. Advertising is partly a
// function of local config — a token is withheld while its enforcement flag is
// off whenever a peer relies on it — so two nodes on one build can legitimately
// advertise different sets, and requiring equality would refuse reseeds that are
// perfectly safe. Schema version answers the question capabilities were being
// asked to answer, and answers it unambiguously.
//
// The quarantine self-report is the second check here, and it closes a real gap:
// pickReseedSource reads the RECORDED isolation row, while a node that has just
// detected its own rollback is quarantined before any peer has written that row.
// Its own Ping is the only thing that says so.
