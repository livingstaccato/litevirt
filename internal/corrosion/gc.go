// Predicates are graded by how strongly inert a row is:
//
//   - resurrection-proof (coreRetention): a recovery code whose set_id != the
//     user's active_set_id (under a live pointer), or an LB backend whose
//     generation doesn't match a live config (or whose config is tombstoned).
//     These are excluded by the v32 active-set gate / v31 generation join even if
//     a partitioned peer resurrects them, so deleting them can't revive auth/LB.
//   - cautious (orphanRetention, longer): a row whose owning pointer/config row is
//     entirely ABSENT. A delayed pointer/config could in principle arrive and make
//     it valid again, so this is treated as malformed/partial-state cleanup on a
//     longer retention, NOT the same resurrection-proof guarantee.

// copy of one of those could validate/render). Returns per-table delete counts.

// monotone UPDATE. This is a lattice state, NOT a delete: it can't un-terminal a row, it
// no-ops on any peer whose copy is still non-terminal (WHERE status IN terminal), and every
// proof consume path already filters `deleted_at IS NULL`, so the tombstone renders the proof
// inert cluster-wide while KEEPING its terminal rank — a tombstone still beats any lagging
// non-terminal copy on merge, so it can never resurrect a spent proof.

// signal that proves every enforcement-relevant member has observed the terminal/tombstone:
// the replicated hosts.state can read `active` for a peer this node hasn't actually reached
// since a partition, so it is NOT convergence evidence. Reclaiming tombstoned rows must wait
// on REAL local convergence evidence (per-peer replication watermarks past the tombstone's
