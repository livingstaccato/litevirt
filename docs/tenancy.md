# Tenancy: projects, quotas, billing

litevirt's tenancy model carves the cluster into **projects** — named
buckets of resources that admission-gate VM creation, support
hierarchical limits, and emit metered events to an external billing
system.

The implementation lives in `internal/tenancy/` (engine) and
`internal/billing/` (event emitter). Operator surface is `lv project`
plus the `webauthn:` / `billing_webhook_url` keys in
`/etc/litevirt/config.yaml`.

## Projects

A project is an RBAC path with attached quotas. Names are hierarchical:

```
/_default               (implicit; every VM lands here unless re-tagged)
/acme
/acme/team-foo
/acme/team-foo/staging
```

Create one:

```bash
lv project create acme --display "ACME Corp"
lv project create acme/team-foo --parent acme
```

`lv project ls` shows every project with its parent + display name.
`lv project rm <name>` soft-deletes; the VM rows continue to reference
the project name but new creations against it are refused.

## Quotas

Each project can carry quota rows. Six dimensions are enforced today:

| Dimension | Unit | Counts |
|---|---|---|
| `vcpu` | virtual CPUs | sum of vCPU across active VMs **+ containers** |
| `memory_mib` | MiB | sum of memory across active VMs **+ containers** |
| `disk_gib` | GiB | sum of all attached disks across active VMs, **each rounded up** to a whole GiB |
| `nic` | count | sum of network interfaces across active VMs |
| `public_ips` | count | NICs whose address parses as non-private per `net.ParseIP.IsPrivate()` |
| `backup_gib` | GiB | sum of `TotalSize` across manifests for the project's VMs **+ containers** |

**Containers share the same budget as VMs** — `CreateContainer` and
`CloneContainer` are admitted against the project's `vcpu`/`memory_mib` quota
just like `CreateVM`, and a container's `lv ct backup` footprint counts toward
`backup_gib`. A stopped container still counts (allocation, not live usage), and
deleting it frees the budget. A project that still owns containers can't be
deleted (`lv project rm` refuses until they're reassigned/removed).

Set:

```bash
lv project quota acme \
    --vcpu 256 --mem 524288 --disk 8192 \
    --nics 200 --ips 16 --backup 10240
```

(Flag units: `--mem` is MiB, `--disk`/`--backup` are GiB, `--ips` is the
public-IP count. Zero on any flag means unbounded for that dimension.)

Admission applies the binding cap = **min over the project and every
ancestor**. A `/acme` cap of 256 vCPU is binding on `/acme/team-foo`
even if no team-foo cap is set. Each dimension gates on
**used + new > limit**; an over-quota CreateVM is rejected with the
violated dimension(s) named, e.g.:

```
project "/acme/team-foo" quota exceeded: public_ips (used 4 + new 2 > limit 5)
```

Multiple violations are joined with `; `.

Current usage:

```bash
lv project usage acme
# project: acme
#   vCPU used:   132
#   mem (MiB):   262144
#   disk (GiB):  3200
#   NICs:        88
#   public IPs:  4
#   backup (GiB):5120
#   VM count:    37
```

Usage is computed at admission time (cheap join against `vms` +
`vm_disks` + the `vm_backups` size index). It is not cached, so an
external tool that mutates the cluster outside the RPC surface stays
visible immediately.

Admission does not decide on committed usage alone. A request first publishes a
**reservation** for what it is about to consume, then re-checks the limit
counting every reservation that was claimed before it — so two requests racing
for the last of a budget cannot both read a view without the other and both
commit. All four bounded dimensions (vCPU, memory, disk GiB, NICs) travel on
that one reservation, and it is held until the workload's row is durably
recorded.

A partial GiB occupies a whole one, and the same rounding applies wherever disk
is measured — what a request is charged, what usage reports, and what the
accounting expects a workload to contribute. So a 512 MiB disk costs 1 GiB of
budget and is reported as 1 GiB used.

## Project = RBAC scope

The project name is also the RBAC path under `/projects/`. To grant
a team Operator on their slice:

```bash
lv role grant Operator group:acme-eng@oidc:corp --path /projects/acme --propagate
```

The grant covers every VM, network, and stack created under `acme`
*and* its descendants. See `docs/auth.md`.

## Project-scoped network & storage isolation

A network or storage pool is either **owned by a project** or **global**:

```bash
lv network create app-net --type bridge --project acme   # owned by acme
lv pool create fast --driver zfs --source tank --project acme
lv network create mgmt --type bridge                     # global (shared)
```

- **Global** (the default, and every object that pre-existed this feature) is
  usable by **every** project — the deliberate shared-infrastructure escape hatch.
- **Owned** means isolated: only workloads in that project (or a root operator)
  may attach to it.

Enforcement is at **attach time**, not just display. When a VM or container binds a
NIC or places a disk, litevirt admits the workload's project against the target's
owner: a workload may use a global resource or one its own project owns, never
another project's. This covers create **and** the day-2 paths — disk move,
replicate, import, replication-schedule creation, and replica promotion. A
raw/unmanaged bridge is outside isolation, so attaching to one requires
cluster-root network authority; a project-scoped workload must use a managed
network.

Reads are scoped too: `lv network ls` / `lv pool ls` show global objects plus
those owned by projects the caller can read, and each object shows its owner.
RBAC follows the object — an owned object authorizes under
`/projects/<p>/networks|storage_pools/<name>`, a global one at the root path (so
only a root grant manages shared fabric).

This is logical isolation enforced at the control plane. A *dataplane* cross-project
L2 firewall deny is intentionally **not** part of it: admission already makes its
firing condition unreachable (two different projects can't share a non-global L2,
and a global L2 is shared by design — put a default-deny security group there to
lock it down). VLAN/VXLAN-range and network-namespace separation remain follow-ups.

## Billing events

Every VM lifecycle transition emits a billing event when
`billing_webhook_url` is set in daemon config. The emitter
(`internal/billing`) POSTs JSON:

```json
{
  "kind":       "vm.create",
  "project":    "/acme/team-foo",
  "subject":    "web-1",
  "vcpu":       4,
  "mem_mib":    8192,
  "disk_gib":   100,
  "backup_gib": 0,
  "bytes":      0,
  "timestamp":  "2026-05-12T14:23:51Z"
}
```

The numeric dimension fields (`vcpu`, `mem_mib`, `disk_gib`, `backup_gib`,
`bytes`) are omitted from the payload when zero. `timestamp` is set by the
emitter so retries don't drift.

Event kinds emitted today: `vm.create`, `vm.delete`. The schema is
designed to extend (`vm.resize`, `disk.attach`, `backup.push`)
without breaking consumers — unknown kinds should be ignored.

Delivery is **fire-and-log**:

- 5-second HTTP timeout — a slow consumer never blocks `CreateVM`.
- One in-band retry on a 5xx response, then drop with a slog.Warn.
- No durable queue. If durability matters, point the webhook at a
  lightweight ingest service (Kafka REST proxy, Vector, etc.) and
  scale that.

Empty `billing_webhook_url` activates `NopEmitter` — the call sites
are still exercised but no HTTP traffic is generated. Tests inject
`RecordingEmitter` to assert event shapes.

## What's not yet built

The tenancy design covers more than this slice ships:

- **Dataplane hard isolation** — per-project VLAN/VXLAN ranges, per-project Ceph
  pool/RBD namespace, per-project network-namespace separation on every host, and a
  cross-project L2 firewall deny. Project ownership of networks/pools and
  *attach-time* admission already ship (see *Project-scoped network & storage
  isolation* above); what remains is enforcing separation in the dataplane rather
  than only at the control plane.
- **Per-tenant PKI sub-CA** — cluster CA issues a tenant sub-CA, tenant
  operators get certs from the sub-CA so root-cluster trust isn't
  shared. Today every operator presents a cert from the single
  cluster CA.

Both are planned follow-ups. The data model is already in place —
adding hard isolation is a host-side networking patch, not a schema
change.
