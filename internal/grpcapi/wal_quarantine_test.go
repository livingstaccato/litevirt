// cluster from latching FURTHER tokens across a member that could not honour them.
// CapabilityActive requires every voting-eligible host to advertise, so withholding
// advertisement holds the line without touching any peer already latched — that
// latch is monotone and stays enforced. The result is the bounded, observable state
// the design wants: majority latched, degraded member visible, nothing new latching.
