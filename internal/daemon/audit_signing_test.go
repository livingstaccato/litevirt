// signing key MAY BE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HANDS, and it told the operator their old
// key had been retired at the sequence its chain had reached and the history it
// wrote sealed under the new key.
//
// On a host with enforcement.audit_signature off — the default, and the state of
// any cluster that has not opted in — none of that happened. The entire adoption
// path hung off that flag, so the restart published no certificate, retired
// nothing and wrote no sealing head, while the command still exited 0 with the
// success text. The operator closed the incident and the leaked key remained the
// only published signing identity, with nothing sealing what it wrote.
//
// Adoption is now unconditional once the dedicated pair is on disk. Installing
// it is an explicit operator act with exactly one cause, and sealing the
// superseded key's history is the entire point of the exercise. What the flag
// still decides — and must keep deciding — is whether this host SIGNS new rows.
