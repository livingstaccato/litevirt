// reportAuditVerify prints the verify result and returns an error — which
// main.go turns into exit 1 — when the log shows interference OR when part of it
// could not be checked at all.
//
// THREE outcomes, kept visually separate on purpose, because collapsing them is
// how this command stops being read. An unsigned row is what every cluster looks
// like before signing was switched on, and an operator who reads "3 rows
// unsigned" as "you have been hacked" learns to ignore the output; by the time it
// reports a real forgery they will scroll past it. So the clean path is one line,
// and a finding gets a headline plus every affected row spelled out rather than a
// count they would have to chase.
//
// The middle outcome — "could not verify" — exists because its one finding is
// forgeable. Any peer can plant a certificate row naming any host and manufacture
// a `never adopted`, so reporting that as TAMPERED handed anyone who could reach
// the cluster a permanent false accusation against a host that had done nothing.
// It still fails the command: a key nobody can read is precisely the state an
// attacker arranges, and it must not read as a pass. It just does not claim to
// know that anyone interfered, because the row it read cannot tell it that.
//
// The two other uncheckable things stay NOTES on the clean path, and the reason
// is the same one this whole split exists for: unverifiable rows are the ordinary
// state of a node mid-rollout, and unattributed rows are legacy data nothing can
// fix. Failing on either would page somebody on a healthy cluster.
