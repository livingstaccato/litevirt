// authorize a fresh transfer. It is the EXECUTOR-side check; the coordinator's
// proofGradeFenceRef already enforces the tighter recentFenceWindow (5m) at mint.
// This window is deliberately WIDER (recentFenceWindow + a MaxSkew margin) because
// the executor compares the coordinator's wall timestamp against ITS OWN clock, and
// a REJECT here is terminal — a zero-margin window would false-reject a legitimately
