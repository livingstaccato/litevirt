// Signed audit chain heads.
//
// A hash chain links each row backward to its predecessor. That catches an
// edited row and it catches a deletion from the middle, because the row after
// the hole no longer links to anything. It is completely blind to truncation:
// cut the last N rows off a host's chain and every surviving link still
// verifies, since nothing in the log points forward to what was removed.
//
// A chain head closes that. It is a signed statement — "as of now, host H had
// written seq S, and its chain ended at hash X" — published periodically and
// replicated like any other row. To hide a truncation an attacker would have to
// remove every head that mentions the missing rows from every node in the
// cluster, and heads are append-only, so a replayed older head cannot displace
// a newer one.

// headSettleWindow is how long a head must have existed before a shortfall
// counts as truncation.
//
// The cluster is eventually consistent, so a peer can legitimately hold a
// host's head before it holds all the rows that head attests to. Replication
// settles in seconds; a head still missing its rows ten minutes later is not a
// replication lag, it is missing data.
