# Configuration

The daemon reads its config from `/etc/litevirt/config.yaml` (override with `LITEVIRT_CONFIG` env var).

# Address the web UI listens on. Defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only)

# a reverse proxy that terminates TLS.
ui_bind: "127.0.0.1"

```

## Minimal config

For a single-host setup, only `host_name` is required:

```yaml
host_name: "host-a"
```

All other fields use sensible defaults.

## Joining a cluster

Every host after the first needs `join_peers` pointing to at least one existing host:

```yaml
host_name: "host-b"
join_peers:
  - "10.0.50.10:7946"
```

Multiple peers can be listed for redundancy. The membership protocol discovers the remaining cluster members automatically, and state replication streams mutations to all peers via gRPC.

## Image-pull controls

URL-based image pulls (`lv image pull <url>`) are bounded by `max_image_bytes`
and `image_pull_timeout_sec`, plus an OPT-IN SSRF network deny policy
(`image_pull_block_metadata` / `image_pull_block_private` / `image_pull_blocked_cidrs`)
— all in the reference above. A pull's RESOLVED destination IP is rejected at
connect time if it falls in a blocked range, checked on every connection, so it is
DNS-rebinding- and redirect-safe. Notes:

- **Opt-in.** With no policy set (the default) pulls are unrestricted and honor
  `HTTP(S)_PROXY`. Recommended on cloud hosts: set `image_pull_block_metadata: true`
  so a hostile image URL can't reach the instance-metadata endpoint.
- **Direct-only when a policy is set.** Enabling any deny policy disables proxy use
  for pulls (a proxied request can't be validated against the post-proxy target);
  connections go direct so the resolved IP is always inspectable.
- **Scope.** The deny policy applies to **URL pulls only**. `lv image import` /
  `push` are streamed over gRPC (no outbound fetch) and are bounded only by
  `max_image_bytes`.
- An invalid CIDR in `image_pull_blocked_cidrs` **fails daemon startup** (a
  configured security policy is never silently dropped).

## Garbage collection

Re-enrolling 2FA recovery codes and recreating load balancers leave behind rows
that can never validate or render again (superseded recovery-code sets, stale LB
backend generations). An hourly per-node sweep hard-deletes them once they age
past a retention floor (`tombstone_gc_retention_hours` /
`tombstone_gc_orphan_retention_hours` in the reference above); the count is exported
as `litevirt_gc_rows_deleted_total` (labeled by `table`).

The sweep is local-only and deterministic (each node prunes its own copy; it
never touches a current-active-set or current-generation row), so it is safe on a
live cluster.

## Ports summary

| Setting | Default | Protocol | Purpose |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| `grpc_port` | 7443 | gRPC/mTLS | API (CLI, inter-host) |
| `metrics_port` | 7444 | HTTP | Prometheus `/metrics` |
| `ui_port` | 7445 | HTTP | Web dashboard |
| `rest_port` | 7446 | HTTP | REST API gateway |
| `gossip_port` | 7946 | TCP+UDP | Cluster membership |
| `dns_port` | 5354 | UDP | VM name DNS |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LITEVIRT_CONFIG` | Override config file path |
| `LV_CONFIG_DIR` | CLI: override the per-user config directory (default `~/.config/litevirt`; holds the CLI cert and stored login credential) |
| `LV_HOST` | CLI: default remote gRPC/mTLS target (`host` or `host:port`; a legacy `user@host` prefix is ignored) |
| `LV_TOKEN` | CLI: bearer token to authenticate gRPC calls. Overrides the credential stored by `lv login`. |
| `LITEVIRT_UNSAFE_NO_KILLMODE_CHECK` | Skip startup `KillMode=process` self-check (development / non-systemd hosts only). Default check protects against unit-file regressions that would kill child QEMU processes on daemon stop. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_ENDPOINT` | Telemetry: OTLP endpoint; turns logs+traces export on. Overrides `telemetry.otlp_endpoint`. |
| `LITEVIRT_OTEL_HEADERS` | Telemetry: OTLP headers, e.g. `Authorization=Basic <b64>` (collector auth — keep in env, not the config file). |
| `LITEVIRT_LOG_LEVEL` | Telemetry: log level `TRACE`\|`DEBUG`\|`INFO`\|`WARNING`\|`ERROR`\|`CRITICAL`. |
| `LITEVIRT_LOG_FORMAT` | Telemetry: log format `json`\|`console`\|`pretty`. |
| `LITEVIRT_TELEMETRY_ENV` / `LITEVIRT_TELEMETRY_SERVICE` / `LITEVIRT_TELEMETRY_VERSION` | Telemetry: `service.env` / `service.name` / `service.version` labels. |
| `LITEVIRT_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Telemetry: trace sample rate `0.0`–`1.0`. |
