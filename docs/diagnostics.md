# Cluster diagnostics

Tools for inspecting and repairing cluster-state health. The **divergence
scanner** (`lv doctor divergence`) is strictly read-only — it never writes or
merges state. **Repair commands** under `lv doctor` (e.g. `repair-owner`,
below) are intentionally mutating and audited; each is called out as such.

## Operation recovery (`lv operation`)

Each mutating VM operation holds a per-VM **mutation barrier**
(`active_operation_id`); other mutations defer while it is set. A crash mid-
operation is normally cleared by the owner's startup recovery, but a wedged
operation can be inspected and force-cleared manually:

```
lv operation show <vm>            # inspect the operation holding the barrier + its steps
lv operation abort <vm> --force   # force-clear the barrier so the VM is mutable again
```

`show` is read-only. `abort` is admin-only, requires `--force`, is audited, and
clears the barrier only via the exact owner-epoch + spec-generation
compare-and-swap — so it can never clear a newer operation's barrier, and an
ordinary mutation's `--force` never bypasses the barrier.

## `hardware_v2` — typed hardware and the one capability with no kill switch

`hardware_v2` makes the typed hardware tables (disks, NICs, PCI intents) the
source of truth instead of the free-form VM spec, and unlocks hardware mutation
on a **stopped** VM. Until it activates, attaching a PCI device to a VM that
isn't running is refused outright:

```
Error: stopped-VM PCI attach for "web" is not available until hardware_v2 is active
```

Every other token in the split-brain/hardening family is gated on an
`enforcement.*` flag you set fleet-uniformly (see docs/configuration.md).
`hardware_v2` is the exception: it has **no flag of its own** and activates on
its own once both conditions hold on every voting-eligible host —

1. **`operation_protocol_v1` is latched.** Hardware mutations need the crash-safe
   operation journal, so it is a hard prerequisite. That token *does* have a
   flag — `enforcement.operation_protocol` — which is where an operator controls
   `hardware_v2` indirectly.
2. **The node's startup hardware audit has finished.** Each daemon populates the
   typed tables from every VM's persistent domain definition at boot, and
   withholds `hardware_v2` from the capabilities it advertises until that pass
   completes. A node that advertised earlier could let the fleet latch — and stop
   maintaining the legacy spec mirror — while its own tables were still empty, so
   a peer would read hardware that isn't there.

One node still working through its backfill therefore holds the entire cluster
at pre-latch behavior. That is intended. Like the rest of the family the latch is
monotone and durable: once formed it survives a restart and does not re-open if a
peer later becomes unreachable.

Use `lv hardware-ls <vm>` to see a VM's typed hardware.

### Adoption state and blocked VMs

The audit classifies each VM as it goes. A VM whose hardware it cannot reconcile
— no readable persistent definition, or a PCI device set it cannot attribute
unambiguously — is recorded **blocked** with a reason rather than adopted.

Before the latch that verdict is informational and gates nothing. Once
`hardware_v2` is latched, a blocked VM refuses hardware mutation **and refuses to
start** until it is repaired and re-audited, failing with the recorded reason.

To clear it: fix the underlying definition or device problem, then restart the
daemon on the VM's host. The audit pass runs at startup, and a VM that now
reconciles is adopted on that pass.

## `lv doctor divergence`

Read-only.



Scans every active node and reports replicated rows that **disagree across nodes**,
plus cluster-wide **semantic-invariant violations**. This is the pre-remediation
evidence-capture step for the equal-timestamp last-writer-wins repair: run it
*before* any change to merge behavior, because convergence destroys the per-node
evidence.

```
lv doctor divergence [--json] [--table <name>]... [--include-sensitive]
```

Admin-only. The daemon you call fans out to every active peer (over peer mTLS),
compares per-row metadata, and returns a classified report.

### What it detects

**Diverging rows** — for each primary key, how the row differs across nodes:

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `equal_updated_at_different_content` | Same PK, **same `updated_at`** on every node, different content — the pathological LWW tie that never re-converges. |
| `stuck_different` | Different `updated_at` that **persisted across both samples** — a converged-wrong or lost-write split. |
| `different_updated_at` | (Transient) usually in-flight replication; only reported as `stuck_different` if it survives resampling. |
| `missing_row` | Present on some nodes, absent on others. |
| `tombstone_vs_live` | Tombstoned (soft-deleted) on some nodes, live on others. |
| `terminal_vs_live` | A workload terminal (stopped/error) on some nodes, running on others. |
| `schema_shape_mismatch` | The table's column **set** differs across nodes (a missing or extra column). Column *order* alone is ignored — a fresh `CREATE TABLE` vs an upgraded `ALTER ADD COLUMN` no longer trips this. |

A divergence is reported **only when it persists across two samples** with
unchanged per-node content hashes — an in-flight replication delta changes between
samples and is filtered out.

**Semantic-invariant violations** — states that survive convergence (every node
holds the *same* rows, digests match, a dump-diff is clean) yet are *jointly*
illegal:

- `duplicate_live_container` — the same container name live on more than one host
  (a cross-host ownership split the per-row resolver structurally can't see).
- `duplicate_ip_owner` — one IP owned by more than one workload. Owner identity is
  fully qualified (`vm:<name>`, `ct:<host>:<name>` with `owner_kind`/`owner_host`),
  so two same-named containers on different hosts are never collapsed into one
  owner.

> **Not yet covered (deferred to a later phase):** *duplicate runtime ownership*
> and *runtime-vs-DB owner mismatch* — i.e. the DB rows have converged but disagree
> with which host actually runs the workload. Detecting those requires per-host
> runtime introspection (the peer-only `GetRuntimeInventory`), which lands with
> the runtime-repair phases; until then `lv doctor divergence` checks only the
> DB-level invariants above. A clean report does **not** yet prove the DB agrees
> with runtime truth.

### Remediating a persistent `schema_shape_mismatch`

`schema_shape_mismatch` fires only on a real column-**set** difference, not a pure
column reorder. A genuine mismatch means one node's table was created with a
different column set than another's — usually an interrupted or skipped migration.
The scanner is read-only; clearing it is a one-time, **quiesced**, per-node
operation on the offending node:

1. **Make it safe.** Move any workload the table backs off the node (e.g. relocate
   the load balancer / VIP) so the node can be taken out of service.
2. **Stop the daemon** and take a **SQLite-consistent backup** (the `.backup` API,
   or copy the DB after a WAL checkpoint, including the `-wal`/`-shm` files).
3. In a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction, **recreate the table from the canonical
   schema of the node's current version**, copy and validate rows, drop/rename,
   then **recreate named indexes and triggers** (they don't survive the drop).
4. **Validate structurally** with pragmas — `foreign_key_check`, `integrity_check`,
   `table_info`, `index_list`/`index_xinfo`, `foreign_key_list`, triggers,
   constraints/defaults/collations, table options (`STRICT`/`WITHOUT ROWID`), and
   `user_version` — compared against a known-good node (not raw `sqlite_master`
   text). `COMMIT`.
5. **Restart**, run `foreign_key_check` again after reopening, then confirm the
   workload listing is unchanged and `lv doctor divergence` (and the cluster
   digest) have converged.

> A pure column-order skew that previously mis-reported here classifies as
> row-content divergence when the positional (v1) digest is in force. The
> order-invariant **digest_v2** (below) makes that skew hash identically across
> nodes, preventing the recurrence entirely — enable it fleet-wide instead of
> repeatedly running the data remediation above for a column-order-only skew.

### `digest_v2` — the order-invariant table/row digest

The default (v1) content digest hashes each row's cell **values in physical column
order**, so a fresh `CREATE TABLE` node and an `ALTER ADD COLUMN`-upgraded node
compute different table/row hashes for logically identical data. The merge is
column-**name**-safe, so this never corrupts data — but the hashes stay different
every cycle, causing perpetual no-op anti-entropy pulls and a standing
`lv doctor divergence` / `lv cluster digest` mismatch on the reordered tables.

**digest_v2** pairs each value with its column name, sorts by name, and hashes a
canonical, order-invariant encoding — so column order stops mattering. It is
negotiated **pairwise by field presence**: a node emits the v2 hash only when its
own `enforcement.digest_v2` flag is on, and any two peers compare v2 **only when
both supply it**, otherwise both compare v1. There is no capability latch — the
digest only *detects*, and each node compares independently, so a non-uniform
rollout only affects which node pulls, never data. `lv cluster digest` /
`lv cluster converge` print a `VER` column showing which version was compared per
table.

**Activation (do it fleet-uniformly, after every node runs a build that supports it):**

1. **Ship** the supporting binary to every node with `enforcement.digest_v2: false`
   (the default). Flag off ⇒ v1-only emission; behavior is unchanged.
2. **Converge** — confirm every node is upgraded (`lv host ls`).
3. **Activate** — set `enforcement.digest_v2: true` in each node's config and
   rolling-restart the fleet (the same procedure as any other `enforcement.*`
   flag). Nodes now emit and compare v2 pairwise.
4. **Controlled resync** — `lv cluster converge --all` (one anti-entropy pass).
   Precise outcome:
   - Column-order-only tables **stop pulling** and read converged (`VER v2`).
   - Strictly-newer LWW drift **may** heal (normal LWW), as always.
   - Genuine **equal-timestamp safety faults still require explicit remediation** —
     LWW never auto-heals a tie. `lv doctor repair-owner` restamps **VM-owned rows
     only** (the `vms` table); other tables (e.g. `lb_configs`) need the quiesced
     table-remediation procedure above or a table-specific restamp — `repair-owner`
     cannot repair them, and `lv cluster converge` labels them accordingly.
   - **In-memory unresolved-tie records do not auto-clear** just because a table's
     v2 digest now matches; they clear on the next daemon restart.

Kill switch: set `enforcement.digest_v2: false` and restart to revert a node to
v1-only emission (peers then compare v1 against it). Because negotiation is by
field presence, a mixed fleet is always safe — never a spurious v1-vs-v2 mismatch.

### `canonical_identity` — natural-key identity resolution

A few tables mint a **random-UUID primary key** but carry a **UNIQUE natural key**:
`snapshots` (`vm_name`, `name`) and `container_snapshots` (`host_name`, `ct_name`,
`name`). Two nodes can independently create the *same logical object* — the same
snapshot name for the same VM — while each mints its **own** id. The replicated
rows then collide on the secondary UNIQUE, and the fail-closed apply path
**back-pressures** (keeps local, retries) rather than pick a winner, so the two ids
persist and `lv doctor divergence` reports the natural-key group as diverging.

With `enforcement.canonical_identity` enabled **and the `canonical_identity_v1`
token latched cluster-wide**, an upgraded receiver resolves these tables by their
**natural key**: it collapses each such pair to a single deterministic winner (newer
`updated_at` wins; on an **exact-instant tie** the smaller id wins **only if the two
rows' non-id content is provably equivalent** — a NULL is distinct from an empty
string, and equivalence requires a **complete** local-schema image, so under schema
skew an uncompared receiver-only column is treated as a fault, never assumed equal).
The collapse **re-keys the surviving row in place** — a single column-preserving
`UPDATE`, never a delete-then-insert — so receiver-only columns a newer-schema node
holds are **not** erased when an older-schema winner arrives. Because identity
resolution *mutates shared state* it is **not** negotiated pairwise like `digest_v2`,
and — like `operation_protocol` — the token is advertised only while the flag is on,
so the latch requires **config** uniformity: a partially-configured cluster stays
non-destructive (nodes not yet opted in keep back-pressuring) and converges once
every node has latched.

**Fail-closed guards** (nothing is silently discarded): an exact-instant tie whose
content is not provably equivalent is an **unresolved identity fault** — keep local,
remain divergent, and track it in `litevirt_lww_tie_unresolved_current`
(category `identity_content_conflict`, keyed by natural key) so it alerts. It clears
only on genuine convergence — a successful collapse/apply, or observing the same-id,
fully-equivalent converged row — never merely because a later observation was older.
A collapse also fails closed if the incoming id already belongs to a **different**
natural key locally (would destroy an unrelated row), or if an existing child
references the losing id (`snapshots.parent_id`, unused today, would be orphaned since
references are not rewritten). The tracker/alert side effects run only after the merge
transaction commits, so a rollback can't leave a stale fault or a false alert.

**Orphaned artifacts:** a collapse whose losing row referenced a **different physical
artifact** — a different `(host, path)` pair — leaves the losing file unreferenced.
The winner's pair is read back from the surviving row **after** the column-preserving
re-key, so a path column the sender omitted (schema skew) is correctly seen as
preserved-and-still-referenced, never falsely flagged. Orphaning covers a different
host (the whole losing snapshot is stranded) **and** a same-host path change (e.g. a
`vmstate_path`/`path` rewrite; because `host_name` is part of the `container_snapshots`
natural key, its collapses are always same-host, so a path change is the only way one
orphans a file). It is **not** auto-deleted — the losing id/host/path is logged (WARN,
after commit) and counted in `litevirt_identity_collapse_orphaned_total` so an operator
can reclaim the space.

**Scanner lane:** while it is active fleet-wide, `lv doctor divergence` keys these
tables by their natural key too, so a still-converging group shows as **one**
content divergence instead of two phantom `missing_row`s; a converged group reads
clean. The lane engages only when the scanning node has latched (uniform fleet).

**Activation** mirrors `digest_v2`: ship the supporting binary everywhere (flag
off, behavior-neutral), confirm every node is upgraded, then set
`enforcement.canonical_identity: true` and rolling-restart. Existing divergent
pairs consolidate on the next anti-entropy pass (`lv cluster converge --all`) — no
separate data migration. Kill switch: set it `false` and restart (the node reverts
to back-pressuring the collision, still non-destructive).

### `canonical_registry` — registry-credential migration

Registry logins mint a **new random `id` per login** and write via a tombstone+insert
batch, so two nodes logging into the same registry concurrently produce two live rows that
collide on the partial `UNIQUE(scope,owner,registry)`. The **canonical model** fixes this by
deriving a **deterministic id** from `(scope,owner,registry)` — both nodes target the same
primary key and a conflict resolves by normal LWW.

**What ships today is preparatory infrastructure, not the fix.** The concurrent-login
collision described above is **still open** — the writer is **not** switched. Every API
write still uses the legacy random-id writer, so two concurrent logins still mint different
ids; a replicated legacy batch can lose LWW on its by-triple tombstone and its INSERT then
back-pressures fail-closed against the peer's live row (safe — no corruption — but it stalls
that sender's stream to the peer until the conflicting state is remediated and the blocked
entry successfully retries; a later WAL entry cannot supersede an ordered entry stuck ahead
of it). This is unchanged from before the canonical work; the reversible core below does not
resolve it.

The one runtime behavior that ships is the **accept gate**: once `canonical_registry_v1` is
**durably latched** cluster-wide, replicated **canonical** upserts are accepted on apply
(before the latch they fail closed). The building blocks — the deterministic id, the
canonical writer primitive (no production caller yet), the idempotent consolidation routine,
and the `RegistryWriterReady` / `RegistryContractReady` readiness checks (computed
on-demand, never cached) — are in place for the future operator transition, but nothing
runs a background consolidation loop and nothing switches the writer.

- **`enforcement.canonical_registry`** (config flag) gates only **advertisement** of the
  token, so a fleet opts in and the latch forms with config uniformity. It is a reversible
  opt-in *before* the token latches.
- **Acceptance is permanent once latched.** The accept gate reads the *durably* latched
  marker (in memory AND persisted), not the flag — so turning the flag off after latching does
  **not** revoke acceptance (which would strand an in-flight canonical wire shape and stall
  replication), and it survives a restart. Flag-off only stops **advertisement** (further
  opt-in); it does not stop `ConsolidateRegistryCredentials`, which the future operator
  transition can still call because it gates on the durable accept latch, not the flag.

**Deferred: the writer-activation contract.** Switching writes to the canonical writer is a
distributed-contract transition, done as ONE atomic operator-run operation: run
consolidation while writes are quiesced; prove a durable replication-sequence **barrier**
consumed by every admitted peer's watermark; prove registry-credential **convergence**;
apply **node admission / reseed** rules for a node returning pre-barrier; **reject the legacy
shape** after activation; and eventually the index contract (partial → non-partial
`UNIQUE(scope,owner,registry)`). None of that is a config boolean — it is intentionally NOT
shipped here, and readiness for it must be recomputed synchronously at that time, not read
from a cached flag.

**Operator runbook — a concurrent-login collision.** A rare race (the same
`(scope, owner, registry)` credential written on two nodes within the replication window)
leaves two different live credential ids for one triple. This is **fail-closed — no
corruption, no silent pick** — but it does not auto-resolve.

- **Detect:** `litevirt_merge_apply_rejected_total{table="registry_credentials",reason="unique"}`
  climbs, and `lv doctor divergence` reports a **stable** `registry_credentials` divergence
  (one triple, different live ids per node). The WAL stream between the two nodes may also
  stall (rising `litevirt_replication_peer_pending_entries` for that peer) — the colliding
  entry sits at the head of the stream and back-pressures the batch until it ages out at
  `MaxLogRetention` (24h). Anti-entropy keeps every other table converged in the meantime.
- **Remediate:** soft-delete (tombstone) the divergent live credential for that triple on the
  affected node(s) — a single `deleted_at` write per node — then have the user re-establish the
  login, which writes one fresh credential that converges. No data is lost; the credential is
  simply re-created. (Equivalently, once the stalled entry prunes, a fresh login converges on
  its own.) The permanent fix is the deferred writer-activation contract above.

### The sensitive lane

`--include-sensitive` also scans secret-bearing tables (2FA factors, recovery
codes, registry credentials, notification targets). Those tables' primary keys and
content are themselves secret — a `recovery_codes` PK contains a bcrypt hash — so
the lane **never returns raw PKs or plaintext**. Each node computes
**domain-separated keyed HMACs** of its rows under a single random per-scan key
distributed to peers only over the peer-mTLS channel (never logged). Identical rows
produce identical HMACs across nodes, so divergence is still detectable, while a
different scan reveals no cross-scan equality.

### Reachability, partials, and stability

Comparison runs only over nodes reachable **in both samples** (per lane). A node
that flaps between samples is excluded from row classification — so its absence
can't fabricate a `missing_row` — and surfaced in `nodes_unreachable`. Under
`--include-sensitive`, a host whose sensitive (HMAC) lane fails is listed in
`sensitive_unreachable`: its secret-bearing tables were **not** scanned, so the
sensitive result is partial for that host and never silently "clean".

The report's `stable` flag is true only when the cluster was **quiescent** across
the scan: the reachable node set was identical in both samples **and** no scanned
table's content changed between them. When `stable` is false, a reported
`stuck_different` may be lagging replication backlog rather than a true permanent
split — re-run once the cluster settles. An unknown `--table` value is rejected
outright rather than scanning nothing.

### Output

Human-readable table by default; `--json` for the full structured report (node
lists incl. `sensitive_unreachable`, per-row per-node `updated_at`/hash, `stable`,
and violations). `--table` restricts the scan to specific tables.

## `lv doctor machine-types`

Read-only. Lists VMs whose **persisted spec** carries an unversioned machine
alias (`q35`, `pc-q35`, or empty) rather than a concrete versioned type such as
`pc-q35-9.0`.

```
lv doctor machine-types
```

An alias is resolved by libvirt against the **local** qemu, so a VM carrying one
can have its guest ABI shift underneath it when it migrates or fails over to a
host running a different qemu version. Two paths already pin the concrete type
at define time — `lv run` (create) and the stopped-VM redefine — and the
reconciler backfills the pin for any VM it sweeps on its current host. A VM
listed here therefore came from another path (clone, import, restore, promote)
and has not yet been swept where it now lives.

To pin one: start it (the reconciler pins on its next sweep) or, while it is
stopped, run `lv update <vm> --machine <concrete-type>`. Neither is urgent on a
homogeneous cluster — every host resolving the alias identically is why this is
a warning and not an error — but it should be cleared before introducing a host
with a different qemu version.

## Persisted LWW clock & backward-clock protection

The `updated_at` conflict key is minted from a **monotonic** clock whose high-water
mark is persisted to `<dataDir>/nowts.hwm`, so a wall-clock step-back or a restart
can't mint an older-sorting key that silently loses cluster-wide. This protection is
**always on** (no flag). Enabling `enforcement.hlc_lww` additionally flips the key
*format* to HLC (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)); the persisted clock works
the same either way.

Operational notes:

- **Sticky future-skew.** If a node's clock jumps far into the future, the persisted
  high-water stays ahead even after the clock is corrected — the node keeps emitting at
  the old ceiling until wall time catches up, and (with `lww_skew_guard`) peers may
  quarantine its writes in the meantime. **Recovery:** correct the clock (NTP) and wait
  it out. As a last resort, stop the daemon and delete `<dataDir>/nowts.hwm` to reset the
  ceiling — this re-opens the backward-regression window until wall time passes the old
  ceiling, so only do it when the skew was large and you understand the trade-off.
- **Re-image / dataDir wipe.** A node whose `dataDir` is wiped loses its high-water and
  regains the regression window until its wall clock passes the pre-wipe ceiling. Ensure
  NTP is healthy before rejoining.
- **Persistence failure is fail-closed.** If the daemon cannot persist a higher ceiling
  and its in-memory headroom is exhausted, it **exits** rather than emit a key below the
  last durable ceiling. Because the state DB shares the `dataDir` filesystem, a full disk
  already fails writes; the crash surfaces it loudly. Recovery = free space.

## Equal-timestamp tie resolution

Strict last-writer-wins settles every conflict whose `updated_at` values differ.
An **exact** tie (byte-equal instant) with differing content is the pathological
case `equal_updated_at_different_content` above: keeping local on the tie is a
per-node choice, not a cluster total order, so the two values never re-converge.

On an exact tie the merge consults a **table-aware resolver**. Every replicated
table is assigned exactly one resolution chain (enforced by coverage tests — a new
table cannot silently get a default). A chain is either a deterministic total
order (both nodes pick the same winner, so the row converges) or it deliberately
**refuses to converge** and leaves the row for a human / runtime repair:

| Category | Tables | On an exact tie |
|---|---|---|
| content-default | inventory/config tables with no authorization, isolation, runtime, or auth meaning (`images`, `hosts`, `dns_records`, …) | a one-sided soft-delete wins, else the canonically-greater row wins (deterministic; converges) |
| runtime-owned | `vms.host_name` | **unresolved** — never adopt an owner by value (it could name a non-running host); defer to runtime repair |
| opaque definition | the workload/resource definition blobs: `vms.spec`, `containers.create_spec`, `networks.config`, `volumes.config`, `stacks.spec`/`compose_yaml` | **unresolved** when the blob differs — the canonical encoder orders specs by their length prefix, so content-max is an arbitrary, non-semantic tiebreak that could silently downgrade a live definition to a stale serialization; a human / runtime repair makes one side authoritative |
| tenancy | `project` on `vms`/`containers`/`networks`/`storage_pools`/`volumes`, `project_name` on `backup_schedules` | **unresolved** when the tenancy column differs (a content-max could silently move a resource between tenants) |
| policy | `roles`, `role_bindings`, `users`, `tokens`, `projects`, firewall/SG tables, secret-bearing config | a delete wins, else **unresolved** (a value tiebreak could converge to the more-permissive grant) |
| auth | `user_2fa` (replay ratchet → max; consume/tombstone irreversible), `recovery_codes`, the active-set pointers | converging rules where safe, else **unresolved** (never resurrect a superseded factor/code) |
| LB | `lb_configs`, `lb_backends` | a non-empty incarnation token beats empty; two different non-empty tokens are **unresolved** |

A table can mix categories in one chain — e.g. `vms` resolves a `host_name` tie as
runtime-owned, a `project` tie as tenancy, a `spec` tie as opaque, and any other
column tie by content-max — applied in that order, first strict decision wins.

`containers` ownership is part of the primary key, so an ownership split is two
distinct rows (not a single-row tie) — detected by `duplicate_live_container`
above and repaired by the container runtime-repair phase, not the row resolver.

The anti-entropy merge is the authority; the WAL fast-path resolves full-image
upserts through the same engine and otherwise keeps local and lets anti-entropy
converge the row, so the two paths can never disagree.

### Metrics

- `litevirt_lww_tie_break_total{table,resolver,winner}` — ties that converged by a
  deterministic resolver (`content_max`/`numeric_max`/`timestamp_max`/
  `non_null_wins`/`lb_generation`). A steadily climbing value means a node is
  minting colliding timestamps (the upstream smell), not just a one-off split.
- `litevirt_lww_tie_unresolved_total{table,path,category}` — **monotonic counter**
  of distinct unresolved ties *observed* (counted once per row, not per cycle).
  Use `increase(...)` to alert on "a new unresolved tie appeared" — a bare `> 0`
  would page forever, since a counter never decreases. `category` ∈
  {`runtime_owned`, `opaque`, `tenancy`, `policy`, `control_plane`, `auth_factor`,
  `auth_pointer`, `lb_token`}.
- `litevirt_lww_tie_unresolved_current` — **gauge**: distinct ties this node is
  *currently* tracking as unresolved. Drops back to 0 when the rows are repaired
  (the per-(table,PK) tracking is cleared on any newer write). This is the right
  signal for "something is divergent right now."
- `litevirt_lww_tombstone_tie_total{table}` — ties a one-sided soft-delete settled
  (a delete racing a write). Benign and expected; tracked separately so it doesn't
  muddy the tie-break smell.
- `litevirt_runtime_owner_assert_total{kind,result}` — runtime ownership repair
  outcomes. `kind` ∈ {`vm`, `ct`}; `result` ∈ {`asserted`, `rekeyed`,
  `split_brain`, `inconclusive`, `error`}. A `split_brain` is a workload running on
  two hosts at once → page; sustained `inconclusive` means a peer the repair needs
  is unreachable.
- `litevirt_merge_apply_rejected_total{table,path,reason}` — **monotonic counter** of
  replicated write ATTEMPTS the apply path refused (kept-local / back-pressured). `path` ∈
  {`ae`, `wal`}; `reason` is a bounded class (never SQL text or parameters). Because it counts
  *attempts*, a permanent fault re-increments every cycle — so alert on its **rate**, correlated
  with replication backlog (`litevirt_replication_min_watermark_seq`) and `lv doctor
  divergence`, **not** on its absolute value.
- `litevirt_legacy_mutation_transformed_total{transformer}` — **monotonic counter** of prior-
  release WAL statements this node NORMALIZED before applying (a supported historical shape, e.g.
  a param-bound `crl_versions` rewrite). A brief rate during a rolling upgrade is expected; a
  **continuing** rate means an old emitter is still writing or a relay is retaining pre-upgrade
  WAL — investigate that peer/relay.

The **signal** is bounded — `lww_tie_unresolved_total` counts a row once and the
alert fires once per distinct divergence, not per cycle. The **divergence itself
is not suppressed**: while a row remains unresolved its table's digest stays
mismatched, so anti-entropy may continue to re-pull that table each cycle until
the row is repaired (a row-proofed suppression that re-pulls only when an
unrelated row also diverges is a future optimization). In practice this cost is
paid only by genuinely-stuck rows awaiting repair.

Resolve an unresolved row by making one side authoritative with a fresh write —
which clears the tracking and lets the table converge.

### VM ownership ties — automatic and manual repair

A `vms.host_name` split is the runtime-owned category: the resolver keeps it
local (never picks an owner by value) and defers to runtime repair.

- **Automatic (runtime owner-assert).** Each host's reconciler watches for a VM
  that runs **locally** but whose DB row points at another host. Before
  reclaiming it, it queries **every workload-capable peer's local libvirt** (the
  peer-only `GetRuntimeInventory` RPC) and re-stamps ownership to itself **only when
  all of them answer `absent`**, no migration/lease marker is present, and the
  condition has persisted past a short debounce. If any host reports `running`
  it's a true split-brain → it refuses to act and logs an alert (destruction
  needs fencing proof, never a host-order coin-flip). If any host is unreachable
  or holds a stale definition → inconclusive → it retries later. This is why a
  segmented host's VM (e.g. one the rest of the fleet can't reach) is left for
  manual repair rather than auto-reclaimed.
- **Manual.** `lv doctor repair-owner <vm> <host>` forwards to `<host>`, which
  re-stamps ownership only if it confirms the VM runs there locally. Use it for
  the segmented case, or to force a specific owner the operator knows is correct.

Either way the fresh timestamp wins everywhere by ordinary LWW and clears the
unresolved tracking.

### Container ownership — automatic runtime re-key

Container ownership is part of the primary key `(host_name, name)`, so an
ownership split is **two distinct rows**, not a single-row tie — the row resolver
can't see it (it's surfaced as `duplicate_live_container` above). The container
reconciler repairs it directly: when a container runs **locally** but its only
live DB row points at another host (and no live local row exists), it queries
**every workload-capable peer's local LXC** (the peer-only `GetRuntimeInventory`
RPC) and, only if none reports it running (a peer's stale *stopped* leftover does
not block; an unreachable/unknown peer does), performs an atomic **PK re-key** of
the container's whole ownership footprint: in one transaction it tombstones the
remote container row **and its managed `container_interfaces` rows**, inserts a
local row carrying the container's `create_spec` and a distinct
`runtime-owner-rekey` provenance marker, rebuilds the managed interface rows on
the local host (veth recomputed), and **transfers the IPAM leases**
(`owner_host`) — so firewall/SG binding, DNS/LB, quota, and IPAM ownership all
follow. It stands
clear of any container under an active relocation/restore/migration (PR #57
markers / `relocate_token`), skips ambiguous cases (a live local row, more than
one remote row, templates), and — like the VM path — only an active worker acts,
a peer reporting `running` is a logged split-brain (no re-key), and a debounce
guards the transition window.

## Operational repair flow

When `lv doctor divergence` reports rows (or an alert fires), work through them in
this order. The ordering is a **safety invariant**: the selfFence non-destruction
guard must be live on every node before the tie resolver runs anywhere, or a
converged-wrong `host_name` could drive a node to destroy a live workload.

1. **Capture evidence first.** Run `lv doctor divergence` (add `--json`) and save
   it — convergence destroys the per-node evidence, so this is your only snapshot
   of who-had-what.
2. **Roll the guard fleet-wide, then the resolver.** When deploying the LWW repair
   itself: get the selfFence guard onto *every* node first; only then roll the
   resolver. Mixed guard/no-guard during the resolver roll is the unsafe window.
3. **Classify each reported row:**
   - **`vms`/`containers` ownership** (`runtime_owned` / `duplicate_live_container`)
     — leave it to the **automatic runtime repair** (it reclaims on positive
     all-peers-absent proof), or force it: `lv doctor repair-owner <vm> <host>` for
     a VM, or for a container that the fleet can't auto-resolve (e.g. a segmented
     host) make the running side authoritative. Never destroy by host-order.
   - **`opaque` / `tenancy` / `policy` / `auth_*` / `lb_token`** — these are
     deliberately unresolved (a wrong auto-pick would lose data or escalate). Pick
     the correct side and make it authoritative with a fresh write **through the
     normal API** (e.g. re-save the VM spec, re-apply the role binding, re-enroll
     the factor). The fresh `updated_at` wins by ordinary LWW and clears the
     tracking.
   - **`schema_shape_mismatch`** — a column-order/shape skew from ALTER history,
     not an LWW tie; harmless but it keeps a table's digest mismatched. Normalize
     it on the next schema touch.
4. **Re-run `lv doctor divergence`** to confirm the row converged, and verify the
   live views agree (`lv ls`, `lv host ls`, per-host `virsh`/`lxc-info`).

> **Never edit `state.db` directly.** Every repair goes through the daemon (an API
> write or an audited `lv doctor` command) so it replicates and is auditable. A
> direct SQLite edit isn't replicated, isn't audited, and re-creates the very
> divergence you're fixing.

## Cluster health: durable conditions and the admission gate (v50)

Health is durable cluster state, not a per-leader memory. Detector findings
(dual-run, owner mismatch, owner-epoch mismatch, coverage gaps, unresolved
ties) live in replicated `health_conditions` rows with an
observed → confirmed → resolved lifecycle:

- first positive scan → **observed** (warning); second consecutive scan →
  **confirmed** (critical for the corruption-class codes);
- resolution needs **two consecutive clean scans with complete coverage** by
  the detector lease holder under a valid decision gate — an unreachable,
  partial, or older-binary peer blocks resolution (blind is not clean);
- leadership changes and restarts preserve counts and confirmed state;
- resolved conditions stay readable for 30 days (`lv health --resolved`),
  then are tombstoned;
- there is **no force-clear**: remove the cause, and the evaluator proves
  the resolution.

`lv health` prints the overall state (HEALTHY / DEGRADED / CRITICAL /
UNKNOWN), every active condition with its involved hosts, evaluator
coverage, peer connectivity, and per-host effective capacity — and exits
0 / 1 / 2 so scripts can gate on it.

**The same rows drive admission.** An active ownership condition blocks
capacity-growing admission to every involved host and runtime-changing
actions on the affected workload; an incomplete local runtime inventory
blocks new workloads on that host; a VIP dual-holder freezes that VIP's LB
changes (and only those). `--allow-overcommit` bypasses numeric headroom
only. Automated recovery (self-heal restarts, owner assertion, container
re-key) refuses any workload with an active ownership condition, and owner
assertion additionally demands the host-local owner-epoch marker be valid
and exactly equal to the DB epoch being superseded — missing, corrupt,
unreadable, or unequal evidence refuses with a distinct reason.

Effective capacity: every host samples the union of its database and
runtime workloads each minute into `host_capacity_observations` — a rogue
runtime the database does not know about still consumes headroom in
placement, and an uncapped rogue container makes the host's capacity
explicitly *incomplete*, which disqualifies it as a placement target until
resolved.

Automatic containment is intentionally not implemented: no path destroys a
disputed runtime. Any future containment mechanism must first prove complete
fleet runtime coverage, a current-epoch authoritative holder, a strictly older
conflicting holder, no in-flight migration/operation/lock/failover, and quorum
or explicit fencing authorization. The evidence and decision must be durable
before any stop is issued.
