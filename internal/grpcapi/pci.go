//
// It requires owner == vmName for the NORMAL contract: it first reads host_pci_devices
// ownership (fail-closed — a read error releases NOTHING and returns recoverable, since
// ownership can't be determined) and, in BOTH the unbind and the release loops, ACTS ONLY on
// addrs owned by vmName, SKIPS an unowned/absent addr, and ERRORS on a foreign owner:
//   - owner == vmName → ACT (unbind if bound, then owner-scoped release). Our own member.
//   - owner == "" (unowned) or addr ABSENT from the owner map → SKIP (unbind nothing, release
//     nothing). In every legitimate normal flow the caller acts on its own owned members;
//     an unowned addr was already released (idempotent retry no-op) or was never ours, so the
//     primitive must never unbind a device it cannot prove is vmName's. (The durable-lease-
//     authorized reclaim of a genuinely leaked unowned device lives in the SEPARATE
//     reclaimLeasedDevices primitive — do NOT fold that reclaim back in here.)
//   - owner == a DIFFERENT non-empty VM (foreign) → do NOT unbind, and collect a FOREIGN
//     failure so the whole call returns a non-nil error. A foreign BDF handed to a normal
//     release is a caller/operator bug (e.g. a legacy detach forwarding an operator-supplied
//     BDF), not a success — failing keeps the op recovery-required rather than reporting a
//     bogus success, and NO caller can unbind another live VM's OR an arbitrary unowned device.
//
// This is a no-op for every current legitimate caller (detach/start-rollback/attach-rollback/
// migrate/releaseDevices all pass the VM's own owned members → owner == vmName).
//
// Per owned member: read the vfio driver state; if the device is bound to vfio-pci,
// unbind it (restoring the host driver from host_pci_devices.Driver). A device that is NOT
// bound is skipped — vfio.Unbind on a never-bound device is not a clean no-op (it clears
// driver_override and reprobes). A bound-check FS error counts as a failure.
//
//   - If ANY member's unbind (or bound-check) failed → RELEASE NOTHING (no
//     ReleasePCIDevice) and return the error. Every member stays owned, and the still-
//     bound ones stay bound, so the caller can leave the operation recovery-required. A
//     retry re-reads vfio state: a since-unbound member is skipped and the release
//     converges — never leaving a device unowned-but-vfio-bound.
//   - If every bound member unbound cleanly → owner-release ALL addrs (owner-scoped, a
//     no-op for a device another VM has since claimed). If any release WRITE errors,
//     attempt the rest anyway (a partial release is safe — owner-scoped release is
//     idempotent) and RETURN the joined error so the caller leaves the op recovery-
//     required rather than completing over a leaked, unclaimable ownership row. A retry
//     re-reads vfio state: the already-unbound members are skipped (IsBoundToVFIO=false)
