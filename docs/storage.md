# Storage

litevirt provisions VM disks through a pluggable Driver interface. Each
*pool* is a (driver, source, target, options) tuple declared in compose
or the host config; every VM disk references a pool by name.

## Drivers

| Driver | Source | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local` (default) | unused | dir override | qcow2 files under `<dataDir>/disks` |
| `dir` | unused | required | qcow2 files in an arbitrary directory (e.g. an externally-mounted SAN LUN) |
| `nfs` | `host:/export` | mountpoint override | mounted lazily by the daemon; survives restarts |
| `iscsi` | IQN | unused | LUNs are pre-provisioned on the SAN; we discover and login |
| `ceph` | pool name | unused | `rbd` CLI shell-out; CGO-free build supported |
| `zfs` | parent dataset (`tank/litevirt`) | unused | zvol per disk; `volblocksize` tunable via options |
| `btrfs` | absolute path on btrfs | unused | one subvolume per disk; qcow2 inside |
| `lvm-thin` | volume group | unused | `options.thinpool` is required; one thin LV per disk |

`SupportedDrivers` in `internal/storage/storage.go` is the authoritative
list; adding a new backend is one entry there plus a per-driver file
implementing the `Driver` interface.

## Pool management

Pools can be declared statically in `/etc/litevirt/config.yaml` under
`storage_pools:` (see [configuration.md](configuration.md)) OR added
at runtime via the `lv pool` CLI:

```bash
# Register a new NFS pool — the daemon runs Prepare() (mount, ping,
# fs check) before persisting, so a misconfigured pool fails fast
# instead of at first VM create.
lv pool create warm \
    --driver nfs \
    --source nas.internal:/srv/exports/litevirt \
    --target /mnt/litevirt-warm \
    --option options=vers=4.2,hard,intr

lv pool ls
# HOST       NAME    DRIVER  SOURCE                                  TARGET                  STATE
# host-a     warm    nfs     nas.internal:/srv/exports/litevirt      /mnt/litevirt-warm      active
# host-a     default local                                           /var/lib/litevirt/disks active

lv pool inspect warm
lv pool delete warm
```

`--option k=v` is repeatable for driver-specific flags (Ceph keyring
paths, ZFS volblocksize, iSCSI portal addresses, …). The full
schema lives in `internal/storage/storage.go`'s `Config.Options` —
each driver pulls its own keys out of the map.

`--project <name>` makes a pool **owned** by a tenancy project: only that
project's workloads (or a root operator) may place, move, replicate, import, or
promote disks onto it. Omit it for a **global** pool (the default, and every
pre-existing pool) usable by all projects. Enforcement is at use time, across
create and the day-2 storage paths. See [tenancy.md](tenancy.md).

`lv pool delete` soft-deletes the row from cluster state. The
driver is asked to tear down (unmount NFS, log out of iSCSI) on a
best-effort basis but failure does not block the delete — operators
who hit "rm" likely want the pool gone regardless. The underlying
mount, if any, stays until manually cleaned up.

## Installer ISOs

A VM's installer ISO (`VMSpec.iso`, the **Installer ISO** field of the UI's
create form) is a file on the target host that the guest reads as a CD-ROM.
Naming one is reading that file, so it is gated like any other host path:

- **A pool ISO** — a plain `.iso` file (no leading dot) directly in a
  file-based pool's directory on the target host, which is what the content
  browser lists and uploads. The caller needs `storage.content.read` on the
  pool, and the VM's project must be allowed to use it (a global pool, or one
  the project owns). A symlink in the pool directory is never pool content.
- **Any other host path** needs `storage.hostpath` at `/`, which only the Admin
  role holds. Upload the ISO to a pool instead.

Some files are refused to everyone, Admin included, judged as written and after
resolving symlinks: the PKI directory, anything in the data directory outside
`disks/` and `mounts/` (`state.db`, `cloudinit/`, `nvram/`, …), and anything
under `/boot`, `/dev`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/proc`, `/root`, `/run`, `/sys`,
`/var/backups`, `/var/run`, `/var/spool`, `/var/lib/lxc`,
`/var/lib/libvirt/qemu` or `/var/lib/libvirt/swtpm`. `/usr` is allowed
(`virtio-win` installs there).

The ISO must be the file itself: an absolute, clean path (no `.` or `..`) with
no symlink anywhere along it, naming a regular file with a single hard link.
Name the real file rather than a link to it (`virtio-win.iso` is often a link
to a versioned file).

The entry node checks authority before forwarding; the owning host checks the
file against its own filesystem. An entry node on an older build forwards
without the authority check, and an owner on an older build has no
filesystem check, so the pool route is only as strong as the oldest host
involved until every host runs this build (as with the other content checks
in [auth.md](auth.md)).

qemu opens the ISO again at every start, so the host judges it again each
time it hands the file to qemu: every start (restart policy and health
restarts included), a snapshot restore, a replace cutover, and a migration
target before the VM lands there. What is judged is the CD-ROM the VM's
domain actually carries, so a VM whose domain was redefined without its
installer CD-ROM starts even after the ISO is gone. A refusal fails with
`FailedPrecondition` and an ERROR log naming the VM and the file, and the VM
stays down; nothing is rewritten. Replace the file with a plain `.iso`, or
recreate the VM without it.

## Compose example

```yaml
volumes:
  hot:
    driver: zfs
    source: tank/litevirt
    options:
      volblocksize: 16k
      compression: lz4

  warm:
    driver: nfs
    source: nas.internal:/srv/exports/litevirt
    target: /mnt/litevirt-warm
    options:
      options: vers=4.2,hard,intr

vms:
  web-1:
    image: ubuntu-24.04
    disks:
      root: { size: 40G, storage: hot }
      data: { size: 200G, storage: warm }
```

## Storage motion

Move a VM's disk to a different pool on the same host:

```
lv move-volume web-1 root warm --delete-source
```

**Stopped VMs** — `qemu-img convert` from source to destination, then the inactive
libvirt domain's disk source is repointed and the disk record is updated in a single
atomic write (host, path, driver, and pool together). The redefine happens *before*
the DB commit, so a mid-move failure rolls back cleanly; if a prior attempt already
repointed the domain at the destination, the copy is skipped so a newer destination is
never clobbered.

**Running VMs** — libvirt `BlockCopy` mirrors writes into the destination while the VM
keeps running. The persistent domain config and the disk record are moved to the
destination **before** the `BlockJobAbort PIVOT` that swaps the live disk — the pivot is
the irreversible commit, so durable state never lags behind a pivoted guest and no
acknowledged write is lost. Operator-visible downtime: zero. The orchestrator
preallocates the destination, polls progress every ~250 ms, and cancels/rolls back on
context-cancel or pivot failure.

> **Note:** `lv replicate-volume`'s copy step uses `qemu-img convert`, which
> needs the source disk quiescent — replicate a **stopped** VM (or a disk no
> running VM holds open), otherwise the convert fails on the disk lock. Online
> `move-volume` has no such restriction: it mirrors via libvirt `BlockCopy`
> while the VM keeps running.

Both paths support file-based pools (local / nfs / dir / btrfs).
Block backends use Replication below.

### Migrating a whole stack

`lv stack migrate-volumes` moves every disk of every VM in a stack to a
different pool. It orchestrates the per-disk `move-volume` primitive: it
enumerates the stack's VMs, resolves a target pool per disk, runs a
preflight, then rolls the moves out **one VM at a time** by default so a
stateful service (e.g. a 3-node postgres cluster) keeps serving. Each per-disk
move is dispatched to the VM's owning host, so a stack spread across hosts is
handled in one command.

```
# Whole stack to one pool:
lv stack migrate-volumes postgres --to fast

# Per-VM / per-disk overrides (most-specific wins: vm/disk > vm > --to):
lv stack migrate-volumes postgres --to fast \
    --map pg-1/data=archive --map pg-2=warm

# Preview the resolved plan without moving anything:
lv stack migrate-volumes postgres --to fast --dry-run
```

- **Online by default** — running VMs migrate via blockdev-mirror (no
  downtime); stopped VMs use the offline convert path. The choice is per VM,
  based on its state.
- **Rolling** — `--parallel 1` (default) migrates one VM at a time and
  health-gates between VMs; raise `--parallel N` for stateless stacks. Use
  `--order replica-1,replica-2,primary` to fix the sequence.
- **Preflight** validates, before any data moves, that each target pool exists
  on the VM's owning host and that source + target are file-based pools;
  capacity shortfalls are surfaced as warnings. Block-driver pools
  (ceph/zfs/iscsi/lvm-thin) are rejected — use Replication below.
- **Resumable** — disks already on their target pool are skipped, so a run that
  stops on an error can simply be re-run to completion.
- `--delete-source` reaps each original after its successful cutover — but
  only if no other disk still references that file (a disk shared with another
  VM, or a base/backing image). If something else depends on it the source is
  kept and the reason is reported; the delete is never the thing that breaks
  another VM.

The same operation is available in the web UI (stack detail → **Migrate
volumes**) and over REST (`POST /api/v1/stacks/{name}/migrate-volumes`, SSE).

## Replication

```
lv replicate-volume web-1 root dr-pool
```

**Native send/recv** — when the source driver implements the
`Replicator` interface, replication uses the backend's native
primitive instead of qemu-img convert:

- **ZFS** — `zfs snapshot` then `zfs send | zfs recv`. Incremental
  (`-I` since the prior `litevirt-replicate-prev` snapshot) when
  `Incremental: true`.
- **Ceph RBD** — `rbd export-diff | rbd import-diff`. Incremental
  uses `--from-snap`. Cross-cluster via SSH wrap on the receive side.
- **BTRFS** — `btrfs send | btrfs receive`. Incremental via `-p` against
  the prior replicate snapshot.

Cross-host replication wraps the receive in `ssh <user@host>` so the
sender pipes straight into the remote CLI. Same-host uses a local pipe.

Crash-consistent by default; quiesce-via-guest-agent for application
consistency is a planned follow-up.

## Backend matrix

|  | local | nfs | dir | btrfs | zfs | ceph | iscsi | lvm-thin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Snapshots | qcow2 | qcow2 | qcow2 | atomic (subvol) | atomic (zvol) | atomic (rbd snap) | external | atomic (LV snap) |
| Move (offline) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Move (live) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| Replicate via qemu-img | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | fallback | fallback | — | — |
| Native send / receive | n/a | n/a | n/a | btrfs s/r | zfs s/r | rbd export-diff | n/a | n/a |
| HA-friendly cluster store | no | yes | depends | no (host-local) | no (host-local) | yes | yes | no |

The **Snapshots** row describes each backend's *native* snapshot capability
(what the driver could do). It is not the `lv snapshot create` code path: that
command always goes through libvirt — an external qcow2 overlay for disk
snapshots, plus `DomainSaveFlags` for the RAM state of a `--memory` snapshot —
regardless of the underlying pool driver.

For HA scenarios use NFS, Ceph RBD, or iSCSI — the disk must survive any
single host failing.
