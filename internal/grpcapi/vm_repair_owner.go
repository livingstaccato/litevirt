// RepairVMOwner re-stamps a VM's ownership (host_name) and running state with a
// fresh timestamp on the host that actually runs it — the narrow, audited admin
// repair for an equal-timestamp LWW ownership split that a stationary VM can't
// self-heal (a bystander node holds a stale host_name at the same updated_at,
// and ordinary replication keeps-local on the tie forever). The fresh updated_at
// wins by normal newer-LWW everywhere, so the stale row converges to the running
// host.
//
// Safety (invariant 8 — positive proof, never destructive):
//   - path-scoped RBAC: requires the "vm.repair-owner" verb on the VM's own
//     tenancy path, enforced on the ENTRY node BEFORE forwarding, so a
//     scope-limited token cannot repair a VM outside its scope;
//   - it is FORWARDED to the named host and applied ONLY when that host
//     positively confirms via its own libvirt that the VM is running locally —
//     so ownership can never be pointed at a host that doesn't run the VM;
//   - it writes only the VM's DB row (UpdateVMHost): host_name + state="running"
//   - cleared state_detail + fresh updated_at. It never touches the running
//     domain, so even a misdirected call can't destroy or move a workload, and
//     is recoverable by re-running against the correct host. Clearing
//     state_detail is intentional: the host has just proven the VM is running,
//     so any stale fence/migration marker is no longer true.
//
// This is the manual precursor to the Phase-3 runtime owner-assert, which
// automates the same write under full all-hosts-absent gating.
