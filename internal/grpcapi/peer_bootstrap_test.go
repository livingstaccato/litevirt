// Peer trust and the bootstrap deadlock.
//
// isTrustedHostCN required the CN to name a row in the hosts table. Hosts learn
// about each other by REPLICATION, and replication is the thing being gated — so
// a cluster where each node knows only itself can never converge. Found rebuilding
// the lab: four freshly provisioned nodes, each with exactly its own row, every
// peer RPC refused with "replication RPC requires peer mTLS", forever. It only
// came up because I had to seed all four rows onto all four nodes by hand.
//
// The certificate is the trust root — minting one requires the cluster CA private
// key, which lives on no node. The hosts table's job is REVOCATION, and removal
// tombstones the row (DeleteHost sets deleted_at) rather than deleting it. So
// "absent" and "removed" are distinguishable, and only the second should be
// refused.
