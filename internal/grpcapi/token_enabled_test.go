// falls to `default: false`, so the fleet never latches it and the rollout
// gauge reads 0 even with the operator's flag on — which is exactly what the
// 2026-08-02 lab run hit for owner_epoch_v1: the backfill ran (proving the
// flag parsed), yet the cluster would not latch and
// litevirt_enforcement_config_enabled{feature="owner_epoch_v1"} stayed 0.

// Every ADVERTISED token needs a case; a silent default is how a capability
// ships dark.
