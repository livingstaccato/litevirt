// Restart-policy decision logic, factored out as a pure function so every
// (cause × condition × managed-save) combination is table-testable without
// libvirt/lxc. Shared by the VM checker (vmcheck.go) and the container
// reconciler (containercheck.go).
//
// Semantics ("guest-stick overrides", per the design decision): a clean
// guest-initiated shutdown OR an operator stop is NEVER auto-restarted under any
// condition. Only an UNEXPECTED stop (crash, failure, fence/external destroy)
// triggers a restart. Because clean stops always stick, "on-failure" and
// "always" currently behave identically here — the distinction is reserved for a
// future mode that would also restart clean exits.
