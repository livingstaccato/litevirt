//
// Why a ledger and not just a lock. Between admission and the commit that makes
// the workload visible to HostFreeCapacityWithPolicy, CreateVM does an image pull
// (a blocking peer stream, potentially minutes), disk creation, cloud-init ISO
// generation, DefineDomain/StartDomain and root PreStart hooks. A lock held across
// that would serialize image transfers and would hold a process lock across a peer
// RPC, which this codebase forbids (see StartVM). But a lock released before the
// commit is useless on its own: two creates would both check, both see the same
// free capacity, both pass, and both commit. So the lock's only job is making
// check-then-reserve atomic, and the RESERVATION is what spans the commit.
//
// Scope, deliberately stated so nothing here overclaims:
//   - The ledger is PER PROCESS. Two daemons admitting for the same host are kept
//     apart only by the single-owner invariant, not by this lock.
//   - It is LOST ON RESTART. In-flight admissions are forgotten, which is a bounded
//     over-admission window, not a durable guarantee.
//   - It covers vCPU and memory only.
//
// For a host that is NOT this node this is a lock-free, reservation-free fail-fast:
// we will not commit there, so we must not reserve there either, and the owner
// re-admits authoritatively when the request is forwarded.
//
// CONTRACT: this is for OPERATOR-initiated requests only. The automated recovery
// paths (startVMLocked, PrepareHardwareForStart, the failover/reconciler restarts,
// operation recovery) must never be admitted — after a host reboot every VM
// restarts at once, and admitting there would start the first few and strand the
// rest, turning a clean recovery into a partial one. Do not push admission down
