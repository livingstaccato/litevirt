// Every capacity consumer used to READ headroom and then write. Two admissions for
// the same project on different hosts each read a view that did not yet contain the
// other, both passed, and both persisted — the cluster ends up over its own limits
// with neither request having done anything wrong. Even the one path that already
// carried a reservation vector wrote it AFTER its check (resize.go), so two
// concurrent resizes raced identically; the vector only protected against
// operations that had started earlier still being in flight.
//
// Inverting the order closes it without a central coordinator:
//
//	reserve — persist a nonterminal operation carrying this admission's deltas
//	verify  — re-read headroom, which nets out EVERY nonterminal reservation,
//	          adding back our own and any LATER claimant's
//	release — free the provisional reservation, whatever the outcome
//
// Adding our own back is what keeps the comparison honest: headroom already
// subtracted our demand, so verifying "delta fits in headroom" without it would
// double-count and refuse admissions that fit.
//
// Deterministic tie-break. If both racers simply refused, the cluster would be safe
// but nobody would get in; the useful property is that exactly ONE proceeds.
// Reservations are ordered by operation id — globally unique, so the order is total
// and every node derives the same winner — and an admission yields only to
// reservations that sort BEFORE it. The earliest claimant wins; later ones see their
// own reservation excluded, find the earlier one still consuming headroom, and
// stand down.
//
// KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than papered over: this closes the race whenever both
// reservations are VISIBLE to both deciders. Corrosion is eventually consistent, so
// two nodes that have not yet exchanged operation rows can still both admit. Closing
// that needs the fenced project-authority epoch — a single decider per project —
// which is the remaining half of F2. This is the primitive that half builds on, not
// a substitute for it.
