// authorityMergeRow is the anti-entropy merge for project_authority_epochs.
//
// It exists because this table breaks the assumption the other immutable tables
// are built on. operations and operation_steps are keyed by a globally-unique
// minted id, so one primary key arriving with two different fact sets really is a
// fault, and freezing it (keep local, flag unresolved, never coin-flip) is right.
// An authority row is keyed by (project, authority_epoch) — a name plus a small
// integer — and ClaimInitialProjectAuthority is DESIGNED for several nodes to race
// it, returning applied=false to the losers. Concurrent minting of one PK is the
// normal path here, not a fault.
//
// Two consequences, both observed on the lab:
//
//   - Two nodes deriving the SAME holder still wrote rows that differed in
//     created_at, because that column is a per-node wall clock. The immutable merge
//     counts created_at as a fact, so it classified one logical claim written twice
//     as a conflict, kept both sides, and anti-entropy re-reported the drift every
//     cycle — permanently, on an idle cluster. Timestamp provenance is not a fact.
//
//   - Rows that genuinely disagreed on holder never healed either, and here keeping
//     local is not the conservative choice it is for a journal. Two nodes each
//     believing they hold a project's authority both admit against its quota, which
//     is exactly the double-decider split D1 exists to prevent. Non-convergence is
//     the dangerous state, so a real conflict is resolved rather than frozen — and
//     still reported, because it means a node's admissions were being decided
//     somewhere it did not expect.
//
// The resolution is a deterministic join: a total order over the row's canonical
// bytes, minimum wins. Every node computes it from row content alone, so the
// result is independent of who merged first and of any local clock — which is what
// makes repeated merges idempotent and the table finally quiet.
