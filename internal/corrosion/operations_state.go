// Operation-journal state machine (F1, v41). The operation_steps table records
// an append-only, per-kind transition graph; this file is the PURE logic that
// defines the legal steps per operation kind and reduces a set of recorded steps
// to the authoritative current state, applying terminal precedence. No DB, no
// I/O — exhaustively unit-testable and identical on every node (recovery reduces
// the SAME steps to the SAME state everywhere).

// OperationKind identifies the workflow an operation drives. Each kind has its
// own happy-path step sequence; all kinds share the terminal states and the
// failure/cancellation/rollback/takeover transitions.

	//                     replaced VM still owns everything the manifest lists.
	//   desired_persisted the replacement transition landed. Written in the SAME
	//                     batch as that transition, so it cannot be observed
	//                     without it, and it is what authorizes the destruction.
	//
	//   released          the replaced VM's IPAM addresses are given back. AFTER the
	//                     transition, not before: releasing first means a delete
	//                     that then declines leaves a LIVE VM whose address has
	//                     already gone back to the pool, locally and in the
	//                     external IPAM. Journaled because the release can fail on
	//                     its remote half, and a best-effort attempt that did would
	//                     strand the address with the cutover reporting success.
	//   config_applied    the replaced VM's resources are freed. It also CLOSES the
	//                     cleanup phase: past this point the replacement's own
	//                     firmware has moved onto the contested name, so re-running
	//                     a name-keyed wipe would destroy the replacement's state.
	//   journaled         the replacement's exact domain definition is DURABLY
	//                     recorded, before anything undefines it. Without this a
	//                     transient redefine failure leaves neither name defined and
	//                     no way to obtain the XML again — the recovery is stuck.
	//   stopped           the replacement's domain is confirmed INACTIVE. libvirt
	//                     cannot rename a domain, and undefining an ACTIVE one
	//                     leaves it running as a TRANSIENT domain still holding its
	//                     UUID — after which defining that UUID under the new name
	//                     is refused. So a running replacement is stopped first, and
	//                     the fact is journaled because the restart that follows is
	//                     owed even if the process dies here.
	//   redefined         the replacement's libvirt domain and firmware answer to
	//                     the new name. The transition alone does not do this, and
	//                     a restart that only finished the cleanup would leave a
	//                     committed cutover with no domain at the name.

	// anywhere between them leaves work a restart can find and finish.
