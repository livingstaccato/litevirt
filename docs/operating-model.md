## Architecture in one paragraph

Every host runs `litevirt`. There is **no master node**. State (hosts, VMs,
networks, etc.) is replicated as a CRDT via the embedded Corrosion store using
the Crescent relay-quorum protocol over mTLS gRPC. Each host's Hybrid Logical
Clock orders the replication log and de-duplicates mutations; row **conflict
resolution is last-writer-wins by the row's `updated_at`** (sub-second monotonic
per node), so all hosts must run NTP (HLC does not arbitrate conflicts). An
**exact-timestamp tie** with differing content is settled by a **table-aware
resolver**: a deterministic winner where any pick is safe, otherwise the row is
kept-local and flagged for repair (ownership/tenancy/policy/auth are never
coin-flipped) — see [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md). Health is observed
peer-to-peer (TLS probes every 2 s).
Failover is decided by quorum among observers, gated by a CRDT-stored leader
lease. Fencing has multiple strategies; safety guards refuse to reschedule
VMs after a fence failure so that the same VM never runs on two hosts at once.

---

## What the cluster guarantees

### Replication
- **Eventual consistency** of all CRDT-replicated tables across all healthy
  members. After any partition heals, all hosts converge to the same state
  for any record whose `updated_at` you can observe stabilizing.
- **No data loss for committed local writes** as long as one healthy peer
  remains reachable before the host dies.
- **Anti-entropy** (`internal/corrosion/antientropy.go`) runs every 60 s
  and is the safety net for divergence the WAL replicator missed. Public,
  operator-readable state uses `StreamStateDump`; eligible secret-bearing config
  uses a separate peer-mTLS-only sensitive dump. The older unary `GetStateDump`
  is retained as a fallback for mixed-version clusters. Convergence is automatic;
  `lv cluster converge` only *accelerates* it (kicks an immediate anti-entropy
  pass) and *verifies* it (cross-host digest report) — it never exports or merges
  redacted state itself.

### HA / Failover
- **Quorum-gated fencing.** A host is fenced only after `floor(N/2)+1` fresh
  observers report `consecutive_failures ≥ 5` for it (where N is non-offline
  active hosts). Stale observer rows (older than 30 s) are excluded.
- **Leader-gated recovery.** Only one coordinator at a time drives recovery.
  The lease is held in a CRDT row with a 30 s TTL and re-validated before
  every destructive action.
- **No double-fencing.** Once a successful fence is recorded in `fencing_log`
  (or operator confirmation under manual strategy), no coordinator will
  re-fence the same host within a 5-minute window.
- **Split-brain refusal.** If a fence fails (and the strategy is not
  `best-effort`), the coordinator refuses to reschedule the host's VMs.
  Operator must intervene.
- **A VM created through `CreateVM` is normally provable immediately.** It is
  assigned its first ownership generation and both runtime markers (libvirt
  domain metadata and the host-local marker file) are stamped before the call
  returns. Previously the row was born at the pre-epoch default and carried no
  marker until the reconciler's next backfill sweep, so for up to that interval
  a running VM could not prove which generation it belonged to.
  **This narrows that window; it does not close it**, and it covers only that
  one path. The row is still published as `running` before the markers are
  written, so a crash or a failure in between still leaves a running VM that
  cannot prove its generation — now for the width of a few calls inside one RPC
  rather than a sweep interval. The dual-run detector's newborn grace remains
  the backstop for that residue, and closing it needs the create path reordered
  to record the row before the runtime exists. All containers are unchanged:
  they graduate on the backfill sweep as before.
- **A VM published as `running` is marked at the same time, on the host that
  runs it.** Every local transition that sets a VM to `running` — start,
  snapshot restore, import, a failed migration healing back, the reconciler's
  self-heals, the health checker's restarts, repair-owner, and replica
  promotion — goes through one of two chokepoints, and a CI guard
  (`make ci-guards`) fails the build on a new call site that does not — and on a
  new statement in `internal/corrosion` that writes the `state` column without
  being registered as belonging to one ordering or the other.
  The two orderings are not interchangeable. A write that leaves the ownership
  generation alone marks first and commits only if the markers landed. A write
  that ADVANCES the generation in the same statement must commit first, read
  back, and mark that — marking first would stamp the generation the row is
  about to leave, which is the marker/row disagreement the dual-run detector
  reports. Three producers that insert a row already at `running` — a clone
  started with `--start`, a live-restore with autostart, and a renamed replica
  promotion — assign the first generation at insert instead.
  **Two gaps remain, deliberately.** Neither is new.
  1. *Ownership handoffs.* Migration cutover, drain, the cold firmware handoff,
     and the health checker's migration retry all commit a row naming a
     DIFFERENT host, while running on the host giving the VM away — whose domain
     libvirt has already undefined. There is nothing local left to mark, and
     gating those commits on a marker write would refuse them on every
     successful migration. The destination marks its own runtime on its next
     convergence pass (at most one reconcile interval, 15s), and until then it
     runs a VM it cannot prove. The source also keeps a now-meaningless marker
     file for a VM it no longer runs; nothing reads it, because its domain is
     gone.
  2. *A generation that moves mid-publish.* The generation is read before a
     non-minting commit and after a minting one, and a concurrent ownership
     transition can land in that window. A marker that lags the row is safe —
     it is exactly what the superseded-runtime check should see when ownership
     has genuinely moved. The unsafe direction, stamping a runtime with the NEXT
     owner's generation, is refused: BOTH orderings re-check that the row still
     names this host before writing anything, and the non-minting one refuses
     the whole transition rather than publish a row another host owns.
  3. *A host that can write neither marker.* One marker is enough to publish, so
     a failed libvirt metadata write falls back to the durable file marker and
     vice versa. Losing BOTH refuses the transition — the invariant working as
     intended — but a host whose data volume is full or read-only AND whose
     libvirt refuses metadata will leave its rows behind while its guests run.
     That refusal is counted on the state-write-failure metric rather than left
     to logs.
- **A marker value of `0` is not a generation.** It is refused wherever it would
  be written — the marker file and the domain metadata alike — and reported as a
  corrupt marker wherever it is read, with one deliberate exception: the
  superseded-runtime check that decides whether a rejoined host may restart a VM
  from local state reads it as generation `0` rather than as unreadable. That
  check does not fail closed on an unreadable marker (which would strand a
  legitimately-owned VM), so treating a `0` as unreadable there would turn its
  refusal into a permission — the dual-run the marker exists to prevent. A
  NEGATIVE marker gets no such treatment: it is garbage, and no decision is
  derived from it. One consequence is visible on upgrade: a VM already running
  with a `0` marker was never provable, and now reports as such rather than
  passing silently.

### Time
- HLC rejects remote timestamps more than **5 minutes ahead** of local wall
  time. One misconfigured peer cannot pin the cluster's logical time forward.
- Clock skew above 1 s is logged as a warning and recorded in the
  `clock_skew` table for metrics.

---

## What the cluster does NOT guarantee

### CRDT is not linearizable
- The leader lease is a CRDT row, **not** a strongly-consistent CAS. Under a
  partition, both sides may briefly believe they hold the lease.
  Consequences:
  - Two coordinators may race to fence a host. Both will find each other's
    work via the `recentlyFenced()` check on the next cycle, but during the
    race window both may have called `fence.Execute`.
  - Fencing primitives are designed to be idempotent (IPMI on an already-off
    host is a no-op; SSH poweroff likewise). Ensure your fence method has
    this property.
- VM placement and other state writes use last-writer-wins on the row's
  wall-clock `updated_at`. **The most recent writer (by wall clock) wins**; there
  is no two-phase commit. If two operators concurrently modify the same VM, one
  set of changes is silently lost — and under clock skew the host with the faster
  clock wins, so NTP is required.

### Even-N clusters cannot fence in a 2/2 partition
- A 4-node cluster split exactly 2/2 has no majority. Both sides compute
  quorum=3 with 2 observers each → neither side can fence.
- **Use a witness host** for any even-N deployment. A witness participates
  in quorum but holds no workloads. Add the host normally, then promote it
  (the host must have no VMs):
  ```
  lv host config witness-1 --role witness
  ```

### NTP is required
- All hosts must run NTP (chrony / systemd-timesyncd / ntpd). HLC tolerates
  ±5 minutes, but **anti-entropy LWW depends on monotonic, comparable
  timestamps** across hosts. Sustained skew above tolerance silently
  corrupts ordering of LWW-resolved fields.
- The daemon emits the `litevirt_cluster_clock_skew_seconds` metric per
  peer. Alert if any value exceeds 5 s.
- **Recommended alerting** on `litevirt_hlc_rejected_total > 0`: if any
  remote HLC has been rejected, a peer's clock is severely wrong; investigate
  immediately.

### CRDT replication is not synchronous
- A write committed locally may take **seconds** to appear on every peer in
  a healthy LAN cluster, longer over WAN. Code that needs "this write is
  visible everywhere before I act" should use a confirmation read on the
  target peer, not assume convergence.

### Secret-bearing repair is peer-only
- Secret-bearing config is **excluded from the operator-readable full-state
  dump**. `GetStateDump` (and the `lv cluster converge` digest report, which shows
  only table hashes) do not export registry passwords, notification webhook URLs,
  or 2FA material.
- Eligible secret-bearing config (`registry_credentials`,
  `notification_targets`, `notification_routes`, `user_2fa`, `user_2fa_sets`,
  `recovery_codes`, `recovery_code_sets`) is repaired by a separate peer-mTLS-only
  anti-entropy lane. Peers already receive these rows through WAL replication; the
  peer-only pull is a repair path when a push was missed.
- 2FA/recovery are LWW-repairable: `user_2fa` soft-deletes, and each of 2FA and
  recovery codes is gated by a per-user active-set pointer (`user_2fa_sets`,
  `recovery_code_sets`). A factor/code is valid only when its epoch/set_id matches
  the pointer, so a row a partitioned peer resurrects (one a node never saw) can
  merge but never validate, and `DeleteUser` tombstones the pointers so a
  delete→recreate can't bring old auth state back. Safety holds once all
  auth-mutating nodes run ≥ schema v32.

### Disk-full is not auto-recovered
- The Corrosion store is a SQLite file. If the disk fills, the daemon stops
  accepting mutations. The cluster does not auto-evict the host. Monitor
  free disk; alert below 10%.

### Manual fence requires manual confirmation
- `FenceStrategy = "manual"` does not assume the host has been powered off.
  The operator MUST run `lv host fence-confirm <host>` after confirming the
  hardware is off. Without confirmation, VMs on the host remain in their
  pre-fence state, **even if the cluster has marked the host offline**.
- This is the safest behavior for clusters using shared storage where two
  running copies of a VM would corrupt the disk.

### No application-aware quiescence
- Backups, snapshots, and live migration are crash-consistent at the block
  level. The guest's database, filesystem, etc. must tolerate "as if power
  was cut" recovery. For application-consistent backups, install
  `qemu-guest-agent` in the guest and use the `freeze`/`thaw` hooks
  (currently best-effort; richer integration is on the roadmap).

## Sizing and deployment recommendations

### Cluster size
- **3 nodes**: minimum for any HA workload. 1-node failure tolerated.
- **5 nodes**: recommended. 2-node failure tolerated.
- **Even N**: only with a witness. 2-node with witness is fine for homelab.
- **Up to ~50 nodes**: tested and supported. Beyond, the relay-quorum
  protocol scales O(n) but the cluster's anti-entropy interval may need
  tuning.

### Network
- **Inter-host RTT < 10 ms**: comfortable. Default replicator and
  health-check intervals work without tuning.
- **Inter-host RTT 10-100 ms**: still works but increase `pollInterval`,
  `healthFreshness`, and `leaseDuration` proportionally to avoid lease
  thrash.
- **Multi-DC (RTT > 100 ms)**: supported in principle; tune intervals up
  significantly. The federation API on the roadmap is the recommended
  approach for cross-DC clusters once it ships.

### Fencing strategy
- **Production with shared storage**: `ipmi` (mandatory). SSH and watchdog
  are insufficient because a network-isolated but otherwise-healthy node can
  refuse SSH but continue writing to the shared volume.
- **Production without shared storage**: `ssh` is acceptable; `best-effort`
  for clusters that explicitly opt out of split-brain protection.
- **Homelab / single-tenant**: `manual` works if you're awake to confirm.
- **All hosts**: configure `watchdog` as a backstop so a hung daemon
  self-fences within the watchdog timeout.

### NTP
- Mandatory. Run `chrony` and verify `chronyc tracking` reports
  `Leap status: Normal` on every host.

## Observability checklist

Operators should monitor these Prometheus metrics:

| Metric | Alert threshold |
|---|---|
| `litevirt_peer_healthy` | 0 for any pair sustained > 30 s |
| `litevirt_cluster_clock_skew_seconds` | > 5 |
| `litevirt_hlc_rejected_total` | > 0 (sustained) |
| `litevirt_fence_failures_total` | rate > 0 over 5 min |
| `litevirt_failover_leader` | sum across cluster != 1 sustained |
| `litevirt_failover_attempts_total{result="error"}` | rate > 0 over 5 min (a failover decision hit a store/fence error) |
| `litevirt_mutation_log_rows` | rapidly growing (replication backlog) |
| `litevirt_replication_min_watermark_seq` | not advancing for > 5 min |
| `litevirt_daemon_open_fds` | > 5000 (FD leak) |
| `litevirt_lb_keepalived_up{lb}` | `== 0` sustained (a load balancer's VIP is not assigned — see [compose.md](compose.md#load-balancer)) |

The web UI at port 7445 surfaces the most critical of these on the
**Cluster** page; full dashboards are on the roadmap.

## Recovery playbook (one-line summaries)

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Host unreachable, fence-pending alert | Confirm out-of-band; if dead, `lv host fence-confirm <host>` |
| Fence failed, VMs stuck on offline host | Inspect IPMI; if power-off confirmed externally, run fence-confirm |
| Two leaders observed via metric | Kill the older daemon; investigate clock skew |
| HLC rejected counter rising on one peer | Check NTP on that peer; expect to fence it |
| Replication backlog growing | Identify slow peer via watermarks; consider `lv host drain` |
| Disk full on one host | Drain → repair disk → re-add as fresh peer |

## Anti-features (deliberate non-guarantees)

litevirt does not provide any of the following. Each is an intentional
boundary, not an oversight:

- **Strong consistency for cluster state.** Use anti-entropy + LWW; design
  workloads to tolerate it.
- **Synchronous cross-host writes.** All writes are local; replication is
  async.
- **Automatic *true* split-brain reconciliation.** A divergence that's safe to
  resolve — a workload running on exactly one host whose DB ownership drifted — is
  reclaimed automatically (runtime owner-assert / re-key, on all-peers-absent
  proof). But a genuine split-brain (the same workload running on two hosts) is
  never auto-resolved by host-order: litevirt refuses, alerts, and a human decides
  (destruction needs positive fencing proof). See [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md).
- **Cluster-wide rolling-upgrade automation that is invisible to operators.**
  Upgrades are explicit (`lv host upgrade`) and can be batched but never
  silent.
- **Multi-master reconciliation of conflicting application state.** That's
  the application's job; we sync metadata, not user data.
