// MutateDesiredSpec reads name's desired spec JSON, applies fn, and persists the
// result under the active_operation_id mutation barrier, bumping spec_generation
// EXACTLY ONCE. It is the sanctioned way to change a VM's desired spec OUTSIDE an
// F1 operation (labels, health-spec repair, a direct stopped-VM redefine); an
// operation sets its desired spec atomically via BeginVMOperation instead. Along
// with UpdateObservedActuals it replaces the old blind UpdateVMSpec so no writer
// can bypass the barrier or the generation discipline.
//
//   - applied=false, nil error → an operation currently holds the barrier (or the
//     VM is gone); the caller MUST defer without writing.
//   - A no-op patch (fn returns the spec byte-identical) reports applied=true with
//     the CURRENT generation and does NOT bump spec_generation.
//   - It NEVER writes cpu_actual/mem_actual (those are observed-live values written
//     only by UpdateObservedActuals).
//
// newGen is the VM's spec_generation after the call (the bumped value, or the
// unchanged value for a no-op / deferral) — thread it into a later
// UpdateObservedActuals so the observation records against the spec it applied to.
