// It used to be `systemctl poweroff || poweroff`, which is an orderly shutdown:
// systemctl queues the job and returns 0 at once, and the host then runs its
// stop units — including libvirt-guests, which waits for every VM to shut down
// cleanly. On the lab the fence read "fenced" at 02:25:12 and the host powered
// down at ~02:27:55, with its VM running throughout. A coordinator that
// rescheduled on that fence started a second copy of a VM that was still
// writing to its disks. A fence has to stop the machine now.
//
//   - `systemctl poweroff --force --force` calls reboot(2) directly, skipping
//     every unit (libvirt-guests included) — the equivalent of pulling power.
//   - `echo o > /proc/sysrq-trigger` is the fallback for a host without
//     systemd: the kernel powers off without involving userspace at all.
//
// The marker is printed FIRST, by the remote shell, so the caller can tell a
// session the power-off killed from one that never ran (see fenceSSH). It is
// assembled by printf so the literal marker never appears in the command text
// itself, which is what ssh would be echoing if anything ever echoed it. The
// one-second pause lets the marker leave the host before the power-off takes
// the network down with it; without it the marker races the kernel and a
// successful fence can read as a failure.
//
// There is no trailing `|| true`. It was once here, and it meant a host whose
// shutdown commands BOTH failed still exited 0, so the fence returned
// Method:"ssh", Success:true for a machine that was still running. That
// success is load-bearing: fenceProvedOff writes hosts.state="fenced" from it,
// and a later coordinator resumes the reschedule from that record alone. When
// both commands here fail, the shell exits non-zero (and not 255: neither
