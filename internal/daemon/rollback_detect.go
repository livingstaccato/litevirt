// preflightCapabilityRollback reports the capability tokens this node has already
// latched that THIS BINARY has never heard of — that is, evidence that a newer
// binary ran here and this one is a rollback below it. An empty result means the
// node is clean.
//
// This is the only place in the codebase that reads the marker DIRECTORY instead
// of iterating the token list. Everywhere else does the opposite, and that
// asymmetry is the whole bug: Checker.SetActivationMarker loads markers by
// walking capabilities.All() and Stat'ing each expected path, so a binary
// predating token X has no "X" string to look for, never looks, and starts as if
// nothing were ever latched. There is no cluster-side record to fall back on
// either — capabilities are only ever carried in a live PingResponse and no
// schema column holds them.
//
// It deliberately does NOT key on schema version. A DB forward of the binary is
// explicitly tolerated (schema.go), because that tolerance is what keeps a schema
// bump reversible and a mixed-version rolling upgrade legal. Gating on it would
// break the upgrade path this is supposed to protect.
//
// Note the shape of the guarantee: this only fires on a rollback to a build that
// CONTAINS this check. It cannot retroactively catch a rollback to an already
// released binary. Shipping it is what makes the next rollback detectable, which
// is the OnFailure-auto-rollback path that motivated it.
