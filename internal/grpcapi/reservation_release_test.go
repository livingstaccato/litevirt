// A reservation must be released even when the request context is already dead.
//
// Found on the lab, not by the fleet tests: a successful VM migration left its
// reservation open forever. `MigrateVM` holds the lease across the whole transfer
// and releases it with `defer`, and by the time that defer runs the STREAM context
// is frequently already cancelled — the client has its result and has hung up. The
// release write then fails against a cancelled context and the capacity is held by
// nothing until the stale-lease sweep collects it up to an hour later.
//
// finalizeMigrationOwnership already knew this: it commits ownership on a detached
// context precisely "because the request context may already be cancelled after
// cutover". The lease release sat right next to it with the same exposure and no
// such protection.
//
// The fix belongs in release() rather than at the migrate call site, because the
// property is general — a release is cleanup, and cleanup that only runs when the
// caller is still listening is not cleanup. Every long-running admitted operation
// (migrate, a large restore) has the same shape.
