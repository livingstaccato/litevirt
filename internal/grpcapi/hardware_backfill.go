// auditVMPCICompatibility reconciles a VM's PCI passthrough intent against the
// AUTHORITATIVE membership source — the inactive (persistent) libvirt domain
// definition — and records the per-VM hardware-adoption verdict.
//
// Design (membership authority = inactive XML):
//   - The set of PCI devices the VM ACTUALLY has is the set of <hostdev> source
//     BDFs in the inactive definition (DumpXMLInactive). A device in the stored
//     VMSpec.Devices blob but ABSENT from that set was legacy-detached and is NOT
//     imported (prevents resurrection). A device owned in host_pci_devices but
//     absent from the inactive definition is a stale/incomplete-detach remnant —
//     quarantined (logged, not imported).
//   - VMSpec.Devices supplies SELECTOR RICHNESS for the devices that ARE present:
//     an addressed spec (resolved address present in the XML) imports with its
//     rich selector (classified via ClassifyPCISelector — a mapping-backed device
//     stays "mapping"/exclusive_key=NULL, an address device pins on its BDF); an
//     XML member with no matching rich spec imports as a concrete address.
//   - Selector↔member attribution is IOMMU-GROUP-AWARE. A portable selector (and
//     an addressed/mapping selector) re-expands at resolve time to its primary +
//     the primary's IOMMU-group siblings (resolveDeviceSpec.addPrimary), so a
//     multifunction card (GPU + its HDMI-audio function in one IOMMU group)
//     produces several <hostdev>s in the definition but is ONE intent. Members are
//     therefore attributed at IOMMU-GROUP granularity: an unclaimed member that is
//     an IOMMU sibling of an already-attributed primary belongs to THAT intent, and
//     portable selectors are matched against the count of independent IOMMU-group
//     UNITS, not the raw member count.
//   - Duplicate identical selectors get distinct ids via the occurrence ordinal
//     (DeterministicPCIIntentID). When the grouping is GENUINELY ambiguous —
//     independent IOMMU-group units a selector set cannot account for — the VM is
//     BLOCKED rather than coalesced.
//   - No trustworthy inactive definition (DumpXMLInactive errors / no persistent
//     def) ⇒ blocked; the caller continues to the next VM.

// protojson.Unmarshal decode. Returns (adopted, reason) and persists the verdict
