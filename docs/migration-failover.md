# Migration & Failover

## Live migration

Move a running VM to another host with near-zero downtime:

```bash
lv migrate my-vm host-b
```

litevirt uses QEMU's pre-copy memory migration:

1. **Validating** — checks VM state, target host capacity, storage compatibility
2. **Preparing** — sets up target host (network, disks)
3. **Copying** — iterates dirty memory pages to target
4. **Converging** — auto-converge reduces page dirtying rate if needed
5. **Cutover** — brief pause, final state transfer, VM resumes on target
6. **Completing** — updates cluster state, cleans up source

Progress is streamed to the CLI in real-time.

### Requirements

- VM must be in `running` state
- Target host must be `active` and have sufficient resources
- All disks must be on shared storage (NFS/Ceph/iSCSI), OR use `with-storage: true`
- PCI passthrough devices block live migration (hot-detach first)
- The target's CPU must be able to run the guest (see below)

### CPU compatibility

A guest whose CPU is derived from its host — `cpu-mode: host-model` (the create
default) or `host-passthrough` — may be executing instructions the destination
host does not have. litevirt checks this **before** provisioning anything on the
target: the source reads the guest's CPU requirement from its live domain XML (for
a `host-model` guest libvirt has already expanded that to a concrete model plus
feature list; for `host-passthrough` the requirement is the source host's own CPU)
and asks the target host whether it can satisfy it.

A target that positively cannot refuses the migration up front:

```
target host "..." cannot run VM "...": its CPU does not provide what the guest is
running on (cpu_mode=host-model, verdict=incompatible)
```

Migrate to a host with an equal-or-newer CPU, or stop the VM and pin a baseline
both hosts support with `lv update <vm> --cpu-mode custom --cpu-model <model>`.

The check is deliberately advisory in one direction only. It refuses **only** on a
positive "cannot run" from the target; a target that cannot answer — a peer
mid-rolling-upgrade that does not have the check yet, or one whose libvirt is
briefly unhappy — is treated as *unverified*, not as incompatible, and the
migration proceeds to libvirt's own check at cutover. A VM with an empty
`cpu_mode` (QEMU's `qemu64`, identical on every host — see
[`lv doctor cpu-mode`](diagnostics.md)) is not checked at all.

### Migration with local disks

For VMs whose disks are on local (non-shared) pools, the disk content is
copied to the target during migration. Pass `--with-storage` on the CLI for a
**live** migration:

```bash
lv migrate my-vm host-b --with-storage
```

The disk is streamed to the target over libvirt's block-copy / NBD channel
while the VM keeps running; the source is undefined after a successful cutover.
You can also set it as a per-VM default in compose:

```yaml
# In compose
    migrate:
      with-storage: true
```

Or cold migrate (stops the VM, copies disks, starts it on the target):

```bash
lv migrate my-vm host-b --cold
```

## Host drain

Evacuate all VMs from a host before maintenance:

```bash
lv host drain host-a
lv host drain host-a --parallel 4    # Migrate 4 VMs at a time
```

Drain live-migrates running VMs and cold-reassigns stopped VMs. When done:

```bash
# Perform maintenance...
lv host undrain host-a
```

## Health checking

### Host health

Every host probes every other host via TLS connection to the gRPC port (7443) every 2 seconds. Results are stored in the `host_health` table.

A host transitions to `suspect` after 3 consecutive probe failures. The failover coordinator takes action after quorum confirmation.

Clock skew between hosts is also monitored — warnings are logged if skew exceeds 1 second.

### VM health

VMs with a `healthcheck` defined in their compose spec are periodically checked:

```yaml
    healthcheck:
      type: "http"                # tcp | http | exec
      target: "http://localhost:8080/health"
      interval: "10s"
      timeout: "5s"
      retries: 3
      action: "restart"           # restart | migrate | alert
```

| Type | What it checks |
|------|----------------|
| `http` | HTTP GET, healthy if 2xx/3xx status |
| `tcp` | TCP connection succeeds |
| `exec` | Command exits 0 via guest agent |

**Correlated failure detection:** If 3+ VMs fail health checks simultaneously, litevirt suppresses automatic restarts (likely a shared dependency failure, not individual VM issues).

## Automatic failover

When a host goes offline, the failover coordinator:

1. **Detects failure** — quorum of observers must agree the host is unreachable (floor(n/2) + 1). Only fresh observations count: a `host_health` row older than 30s, or dated more than 30s ahead of the coordinator's own clock (a skewed observer), is not evidence
2. **Acquires leader lease** — suppresses concurrent coordinators (45s TTL lease; a fence needs 30s of it still to run before it may begin). Best-effort, not exclusive: a CRDT lease can be held on both sides of a partition, so the decide site also requires a locally-probed quorum (`DecisionGate`) and the minority side fails closed there. See [Operating model](operating-model.md) → "Leader-gated recovery".
3. **Fences the failed host** — prevents split-brain by ensuring the failed host cannot access shared resources
4. **Reschedules VMs** — based on each VM's `on-host-failure` policy

### Fencing methods

| Method | How it works |
|--------|-------------|
| `ipmi` | Power cycle via IPMI/BMC (requires `ipmi_address`, `ipmi_user`, `ipmi_pass` on host). Verified post-fence by polling `chassis power status`. |
| `ssh` | Forced, immediate power-off over SSH: `systemctl poweroff --force --force`, falling back to `echo o > /proc/sysrq-trigger`. Not a graceful shutdown — no units are stopped, so `libvirt-guests` does not get to shut guests down cleanly first; the host stops now, as if its power were pulled. The session dies with the host, and that is reported as success only when the remote shell had already confirmed it was issuing the power-off. Reports failure if the host is unreachable or both power-off commands fail. |
| `watchdog` | Local watchdog self-fence (the host writes its own watchdog timer dead). Requires `watchdog_dev` in config. When `watchdog_dev` is set the daemon validates the device at startup and refuses to start if it's absent, so a broken watchdog is caught before it's needed rather than at fence time (override: `LITEVIRT_UNSAFE_SKIP_WATCHDOG_CHECK=1`). On a graceful daemon shutdown the watchdog is disarmed only when this host owns no running VMs or containers; while it owns any, the device stays armed — a restarting daemon resumes petting well inside the timeout, and a daemon stopped for good with workloads left behind lets the watchdog reboot the host into a safely fenced state. Drain (or `lv host shutdown-workloads`) before planned maintenance. |
| `manual` | Coordinator does NOT auto-reschedule; operator must run `lv host fence-confirm <host>` after physically powering it off. Required when shared storage would corrupt under split-brain. |
| `best-effort` | Tries the same forced SSH power-off as `ssh`; succeeds regardless. Used in homelabs / single-tenant clusters that explicitly opt out of split-brain protection. |

Configure per-host:

```bash
lv host config host-b \
  --fence-strategy ipmi \
  --ipmi-address 10.0.50.111 \
  --ipmi-user admin \
  --ipmi-pass <secret>
```

### Manual fence confirmation flow

Under `manual` strategy, the failover coordinator records the failure but
refuses to reschedule VMs until an operator confirms the host is genuinely
powered off:

```bash
# Quorum has detected host-b unreachable. VMs on host-b are NOT
# automatically restarted yet (which would be split-brain on shared NFS).
# Operator powers off host-b out of band, then:
lv host fence-confirm host-b
# Next coordinator cycle reschedules the VMs.
```

The coordinator marks the host `fenced` once `lv host fence-confirm`
records a `manual-confirmed` row in `fencing_log`. This gate prevents
the coordinator from rescheduling a manually-fenced host's VMs before
an operator has actually confirmed the fence.

### Shared-disk fence gating (host-fence-gated shared storage)

A VM whose disk lives on **shared** storage (NFS/Ceph/RBD/iSCSI) is a special
split-brain hazard: the same bytes are writable from any host, so starting the VM
on a second host while the original owner may still be writing corrupts the disk.
A local-disk replica is a *different* image, so promoting it carries no such hazard.

When `enforcement.shared_storage_fence` is enabled (and the cluster has latched the
`shared_storage_fence_v1` capability), an **ownership transfer** — auto-promote or
reschedule — of a VM with a writable shared disk starts only once the old owner is
**proven powered off**:

- Accepted: a confirmed power-off (`ipmi`), or an operator `lv host fence-confirm`
  (`manual-confirmed`).
- Rejected: a `best-effort`/`ssh` fence — a lenient SSH poweroff reports success but
  never confirms the host is down.

The proof is bound to the specific fence in the failover proof's `fence_epoch`, and
the executing host re-verifies it against the append-only `fencing_log` (never a
stale `fenced` host state). If the proof reference hasn't replicated to the executor
yet the transfer retries on the next cycle; a missing or non-proof-grade fence is
refused with the `storage_unverified` reason.

Enforcement is fail-closed at **both** ends. The coordinator refuses to *create* a
shared-disk transfer at the source when it has no proof-grade fence (a best-effort
fence yields an empty `fence_epoch`), so a target that is a mixed-rollout laggard
(has the capability but not yet the config flag) or a regressed binary can never
receive an *unfenced* shared-disk transfer. When a proof-grade fence does exist the
owner is provably powered off, so the transfer is safe even if the target hasn't
enabled the flag. The executor re-verifies as defense-in-depth.

This is **host-fence-gated shared storage, not storage-level exclusivity** — litevirt
does not (yet) take storage-side locks (RBD blocklist, iSCSI PR keys). It is a
config kill-switch (`enforcement.shared_storage_fence`) plus the capability latch, so
an UPGRADE is behavior-neutral until the flag is enabled fleet-uniformly, and disabling
it restores the legacy behavior. The flag is false when absent — but a cluster created
with `lv host init` starts with it on, because there is no prior behavior to preserve
and the unguarded outcome is two hosts writing one disk. Hosts joining an existing
cluster inherit that cluster's setting, never this default.

**Requiring a verified fence, per host.** By default a successful SSH fence is
enough for the coordinator that ran it to reschedule the host's local-disk VMs.
An SSH success only means a shell accepted a forced power-off; nothing checks the
host went down. To refuse that on a particular host:

```bash
lv host label set <host> litevirt.fence_requires_confirmation=true
```

With the label, a fence that did not **verify** the power-off — `ssh`, and
`best-effort` in both its forms — no longer reschedules anything and no longer
records the host as `fenced`; it is left `offline`. An IPMI fence, which does
verify, is unaffected. The fence's assurance is shown by `lv doctor fence` and
`lv host fence` (see [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)).

It is a label rather than a config flag because only one place acts on it — the
coordinator creating the recovery — so no peer needs to honour it, and a
coordinator on an older binary ignores it and behaves exactly as before. Roll
the binary out before relying on it.

**Getting past the refusal.** Confirm the host is powered off, then run
`lv host fence-confirm <host>`. The coordinator resumes the recovery on its next
cycle — see [Resuming a recovery from a confirmation](#resuming-a-recovery-from-a-confirmation).

### Resuming a recovery from a confirmation

A recovery refused for want of a confirmation — a `manual` fence, a
`best-effort` fence under the safe-fence policy, or a host labelled
`litevirt.fence_requires_confirmation` — resumes once an operator runs
`lv host fence-confirm <host>`. Before this, it never did: the refusal marked the
host handled for the outage, nothing looked at it again, and the confirmation
landed on a host no code path would revisit, in the same process or after a
restart.

The resume requires three things, not the confirmation alone:

1. **The cluster itself fenced the host** — a `fencing_log` row with result
   `fenced` or `partial`, which only a fence that ran writes.
2. **The confirmation is newer than that fence**, so it attests to this outage
   and not an earlier one.
3. **The host is still down now** — a fresh quorum observes it failing. A host
   that has come back, or that an operator has put into `maintenance`, is never
   resumed.

`fence-confirm` has no precondition and runs no fence, so on its own a mistyped
hostname could otherwise authorise a recovery. With all three required, a
mistype can only reach a host the cluster already fenced and still sees down.

**Confirm after the fence, not before.** A confirmation written before the
coordinator has fenced the host is not newer than any fence, so it resumes
nothing — and while it is under 5 minutes old it also makes the coordinator
treat the host as already fenced. Wait for the refusal in the coordinator log,
then confirm.

**The failover leader resumes it.** Every coordinator reads the same
`fencing_log`, but only the one holding the failover lease acts on it. The check
is the same one fencing uses, run once per cycle and again for each host before
anything is decided. A coordinator that is not the leader does nothing and does
not spend the confirmation. If the leader that refused the recovery dies before
the confirmation arrives, the coordinator that takes over the lease finds the
confirmation in `fencing_log` and resumes the recovery. The lease is best-effort,
not exclusive (see
[Leader-gated recovery](operating-model.md#ha--failover)). If two
coordinators each believe they hold it, both can resume, just as both can fence.

The resume also takes the decision gate, like every other ownership decision: a
coordinator without quorum refuses, and does not spend the confirmation, so the
resume happens once quorum returns. One confirmation resumes one recovery. It is
counted as `phase=recovery, error_class=confirmation_resumed`. A shared-disk VM
still needs a proof-grade fence reference, which a confirmation under 5 minutes
old provides; a resume long after the confirmation (a daemon restart hours
later) moves local-disk VMs and refuses shared-disk ones, which is the safe
direction.

**Per-host implication:** a host whose fence strategy is `best-effort`/`ssh`/`manual`
(anything but `ipmi`) gives its shared-disk VMs *manual-confirm-only* automated
failover once this is enforced. `lv host inspect <host>` prints a note when a host's
fence strategy can't prove a power-off. Give shared-disk hosts an IPMI fence strategy,
or expect to run `lv host fence-confirm` for their failover.

Local-disk VMs are unaffected: their transfers keep the existing quorum/proof gate
(a `best-effort` fence is sufficient — no shared-write hazard).

### Witness hosts (even-N quorum)

For 2-node or 4-node deployments, add a vote-only witness host to break
ties cleanly:

```bash
lv host config witness-1 --role witness
```

Witnesses participate in failover quorum but never run workloads. The
placement engine refuses to schedule any VM onto them. See
[operating-model.md](operating-model.md) for sizing guidance.

### VM failure policies

Set in compose `migrate` section:

```yaml
    migrate:
      on-host-failure: "restart-any"
```

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `restart-any` | Restart on any available healthy host |
| `restart-same` | Wait for original host to recover |
| `none` | Do not reschedule |

## Load-balancer VIP split-brain safety

Load-balancer VIPs (keepalived/VRRP) are protected against split-brain by the same core
rule as VM/container ownership: **no quorum or proof ⇒ no new ownership action. A safe gap
(a VIP briefly down) is acceptable; two hosts answering the same VIP is the bug.**

This hardening is **capability-gated and rolled out per-cluster** — it activates only once
every participating host advertises support, so a mixed-version cluster keeps its previous
behavior until the whole fleet can enforce it. **No hardware watchdog is required** for any
of it; a watchdog, where present, is only an optional self-fence backstop.

### Minority self-demotes

An isolated load-balancer host that loses quorum stands its **own** VIPs down — stops
keepalived and removes the address — so it can't keep answering on the wrong side of a
partition. A brief blip never triggers this (there's a sustained-loss threshold,
`quorum_loss_demote_after_sec`); a freshly-restarted host still in warm-up never drops a
healthy VIP. If the stand-down can't be confirmed (e.g. a wedged keepalived) and the host
has a verified hardware watchdog, it self-fences; otherwise it keeps retrying and raises a
persistent `HA degraded` status rather than ever pretending to be down.

### Majority reclaims only with proof

The surviving majority (re)claims a VIP only on **proof the old holder has released it** —
either the old holder is reachable (directly, or relayed through a peer that can reach it)
and reports the VIP absent, or an operator has attested it is down (below). If the old
holder is **unreachable and unproven**, the majority leaves the VIP **down and raises an
alert** — an outage, never a blind takeover. This is the `safe` policy, and it is the only
supported one:

```yaml
# daemon config — the default; the only accepted value
no_quorum_vip_policy: safe
```

There is intentionally **no** weaker "take over after a timeout without proof" tier — it
would reintroduce the dual-master risk this feature exists to prevent. The supported way to
recover a stuck VIP is the manual fence-confirm below, not a weaker policy.

### Recovering a VIP from a dead, unreachable holder

If a VIP's holder has failed and can't be reached — and you need the VIP back — verify the
host is genuinely powered off out-of-band (IPMI / PDU / console), then attest it:

```bash
lv host fence-confirm <host>
```

This is the same operator attestation that releases a manually-fenced host's VMs, and it
also releases that host's VIPs: a host you have confirmed down has, by definition, let go of
its VIP, so the majority reclaims it. The attestation is trusted only briefly (re-run it if
recovery drags on), and **only an explicit `fence-confirm` counts** — an automatic fence
*attempt* that may have partially failed does not. This is the answer to "I need my VIP
back now": a fast, safe, operator-driven override — no weaker cluster-wide policy needed.

### Coverage boundaries

- A **data-plane-only** partition — gRPC/gossip quorum intact on both sides but the VRRP L2
  segment split — is not auto-resolved (neither side loses quorum, so neither self-demotes).
  Watch for a VIP-conflict alert and resolve the L2 fault.
- Reclaiming an unreachable holder's VIP **automatically** (without the manual attestation
  above) requires proof-grade fencing (IPMI power-off / SBD), a separate optional rollout.
  Until then the unreachable case is a deliberate availability trade-off: VIP down + alert,
  recovered by the fence-confirm step above.

## Containers

**Cold migration** — `lv ct migrate <name> <target> --repo <dir>` moves a
container to another host by reusing the backup→restore transport (stop →
archive → restore on target → restart if it was running). The source archives
into `--repo` locally and **streams the manifest to the target over peer mTLS**
(into a per-transfer staging repo), so `--repo` no longer needs to be reachable
from both hosts. If the target predates peer streaming it falls back to
re-opening `--repo` by name, which then must be shared. No live/CRIU migration.

**Host-loss relocation** — when a host is fenced, the failover coordinator
relocates its containers that carry an `on_host_failure` policy (set with
`lv ct create --on-host-failure image-recreate`) onto a placement-chosen healthy
host, preferring the most faithful option: **restore from the latest backup**
(`ct.relocate.restored` — preserves networking + non-image state, when a
reachable repo holds a valid manifest and the survivor is schema-compatible),
falling back to **recreate from image** (`ct.relocate.recreate` — managed NICs
reconstructed from the persisted create spec), and finally **skip** a container
that's neither restorable nor re-pullable (`ct.relocate.skipped`, left visible for
operator recovery). The restore path is idempotent + crash-recoverable (source
marker `relocate-restore:<target>:<token>`, where the attempt token is stamped on
the restored target row so the coordinator only completes the handoff against a
row proven to be its own restore; `container_restore_timeout_sec`). See
[containers.md](containers.md#host-loss-relocation).

  `fenced`/`offline` that failover would move off a dead host. This node's view, so it reads `0`

- `litevirt_replication_pending_entries` — `mutation_log` entries written but not yet acknowledged by the slowest **live** peer (`MAX(seq) − MIN(live last_seq)`); reads `0` when there are no live peers. A sustained climb means one peer is falling behind even though replication itself is healthy
- `litevirt_replication_backlog_age_seconds` — how long the oldest entry the slowest **live** peer has not acknowledged has been waiting on this node; `0` when caught up or when there are no live peers. **The one to alert on.** `pending_entries` measures volume, which is the wrong quantity for a threshold — a thousand entries a second behind is healthy, three entries an hour behind is a peer that has stopped acknowledging. The age is measured on this hop: a relay's forwarded entries are stamped when they land in the relay's log
- `litevirt_replication_peer_pending_entries` — per-peer backlog (`MAX(seq) − peer last_seq`), one series per live peer; a single series climbing while the others stay flat pinpoints the lagging peer. The daemon also logs a warning when a peer stays maxed-out for several rounds
