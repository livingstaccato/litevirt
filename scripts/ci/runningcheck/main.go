// Command runningcheck enforces litevirt's marker chokepoint: a VM row must
// never say "running" without a marker naming the ownership generation that
// runtime belongs to.
//
// A row that says running while no marker names its generation is a workload
// nobody can prove. That window is what the dual-run detector's newborn grace
// exists to tolerate, so closing it everywhere is what eventually makes that
// grace deletable — and a new unrouted call site would silently reopen it.
//
// There are two publish orderings — mark-then-commit for a writer that leaves
// the ownership generation alone, commit-then-mark for one that advances it in
// the same statement. internal/health/publish.go states why; this tool only has
// to enforce that each writer takes the right one, because using the WRONG
// ordering is as much a defect as using neither.
//
// The rules, all AST-checked:
//
//  1. A non-minting primitive whose state argument is a string literal other
//     than "running" is exempt — it cannot publish a running VM. Any other
//     state argument (literal "running", or a value only known at runtime) must
//     be inside a closure handed to a publish helper.
//  2. A minting primitive must always be inside such a closure, and it must be a
//     MINTED helper. There is no state argument to exempt it by.
//  3. A closure assigned to a variable and handed to a publish helper may ALSO
//     be invoked directly, but only inside a branch that has proven the state is
//     not "running" — otherwise the routing is decorative and the direct call
//     publishes unmarked.
//  4. A corrosion.VMRecord literal born at "running" — or at a state only known
//     at runtime — must be graduated by an assignOwnerEpochAtCreate call in the
//     same function. An insert lands at the vm_owner_epoch column default of 0,
//     convergence early-returns on zero, and the backfill that would graduate it
//     is gated behind enforcement.owner_epoch, which is off by default.
//  5. Every SQL statement in production code that writes the vms.state column
//     must be registered in the stateWritingStatements inventory below. Rules 1-4
//     police call sites against hand-maintained maps of writer NAMES, and a map
//     nobody is forced to update is a guard that decays — UpdateVMHost sat in one
//     as permanently exempt for exactly that reason. This rule closes the loop
//     from the other end: a new state writer fails the build until someone says
//     which ordering it takes. `runningcheck -inventory` prints what to add.
//
// A site that genuinely cannot be routed opts out with a trailing
// `//runningcheck:allow <reason>` comment on any line the statement spans. The
// four ownership HANDOFFS use this: they commit a row that names a DIFFERENT
// host while running on the host giving the VM away, whose domain libvirt has
// already undefined. Marking there would stamp a runtime that is going away, and
// for the post-cutover commit it would refuse the commit outright on every
// successful migration.
//
// Usage:
//
//	runningcheck -root .        # walk <root> for production .go files; exit 1 on any violation
