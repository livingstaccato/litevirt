// Host-loss relocation is the other genuinely multi-node container path: when a
// host is fenced, its containers' rootfs died with it, so the coordinator
// re-homes what it can rebuild (a re-pullable image) and refuses to touch what
// it cannot (coordinator.go:1338).
//
// The refusals are the part worth pinning. A container whose data cannot be
// recovered must be left VISIBLE for an operator rather than silently recreated
// empty or dropped — and a same-name container already running on the survivor
// must never be clobbered by the relocation of an unrelated one (container
// names are keyed (host_name, name), not cluster-unique).

// fenceVictim marks victim as failed by quorum and runs one coordinator cycle on
// coordNode, returning how many times the fencer fired.
//
// The health rows must be RFC3339: the coordinator's freshness gate compares
// against an RFC3339 cutoff, and SQLite's space-separated datetime('now') sorts
// before any 'T'-separated stamp, so such a row reads as permanently stale and
// never reaches quorum (see failover_test.go).
