// Audit renderings for security groups (colonelpanik/litevirt#182).
//
// This is the security-group subset of the firewall audit renderings on the
// fork's main, carried here so the security-group RPCs record the same rows
// main records. The cluster-, host-tier and ip-set renderings are not needed
// by anything on this branch and are left out.
//
// A security-group audit row records the policy a mutation replaced and the
// policy it left, as `before=<state> after=<state>`. The "before" is the half
// that matters: a removed rule is tombstoned, so once it is gone the audit log
// is the only place that can still say which port the removal opened.
//
// The states are:
//
//	{...}    a rule or group, every field that decides what it matches or does
//	none     a read that SUCCEEDED found no such row
//	unknown  the read failed, so nothing is claimed about what was there
//
// "none" and "unknown" are kept apart on purpose. A failed read must not be
// recorded as absence: that would turn a lookup error into a signed statement
// that nothing was removed.
