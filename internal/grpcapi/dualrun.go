// past it is a genuinely WEDGED backfill that must surface, not newborn noise.

//
// The window is bounded in BOTH directions, which a bare "younger than the
// grace" test is not: time.Since is NEGATIVE for a created_at in the future and
// every negative duration is less than the grace, so a row stamped in the year
// 9999 would sit in the exception forever and permanently lose owner-epoch
// protection without ever paging. That is reachable without an attacker (a
// creator whose clock is badly wrong) and with one (created_at is a replicated
// column, and corrosion is last-writer-wins, so any peer can write it) — a
// detector must not have an input that switches it off indefinitely.
//
// A modest future stamp is honest clock skew between the creator and whichever
// host is evaluating, and still earns the exception; the same grace bounds it on
// that side, so any ONE stamp buys at most two grace windows of suppression.
//
// Be precise about what that does and does not buy. It bounds a stamp that is
// wrong ONCE — a bad creator clock, a wedged backfill, a row forged and left
// alone. It does NOT bound a peer that REWRITES created_at before each pass:
// this is re-evaluated against freshly-read DB state every sweep, so a renewed
// stamp keeps the exception open indefinitely. That is not a property this
// predicate can recover on its own.
//
// It used to be worse. The same writer could suppress the whole epoch check
// more cheaply — and WITHOUT renewing — by setting state to a migrationState,
// setting deleted_at (ListVMs filters it), or pointing host_name at a host
// that is never probed. Those three are no longer silent: each is now
// corroborated against runtime evidence this leader gathered itself, and a row
// that says "do not look" while the runtime says the workload is running
// raises kindEpochSuppressed. See the three SUPPRESSION blocks in
// detectDualRunPass.
//
// That narrows the boundary; it does not close it. The detector still judges
// replicated state using replicated state, and a writer who ALSO stops the
// workload, or who owns the host doing the probing, is not caught by any of
// this. Closing it properly means either detector-owned durable state the
