// Capacity policy: how much of a host litevirt is willing to hand to workloads.
//
// This is the SINGLE place that answer is computed. It used to be three: the
// admission check, the placement engine, and the VM reconciler each did their own
// `total - used`, which is how `lv run --host` (no check at all) and `lv update`
// (checked) came to disagree — one refused what the other had just allowed.
//
// Two knobs, deliberately with OPPOSITE defaults, because CPU and memory are not
// alike:
//
//   - vCPU is time-sliced. Running more vCPUs than cores is normal; the guests
//     simply share. Oversubscribing is the point, so the default ratio is >1.
//   - Memory is not. A guest's RAM is either backed or it is not, and without
//     ballooning/KSM/swap, handing out more than exists means the kernel starts
//     reclaiming and the host thrashes. The default ratio is exactly 1.
//
// And a reserve, which matters more than either ratio: even at ratio 1.0,
// "free = total - guests" hands guests 100% of RAM and leaves nothing for the
// kernel, page cache, qemu's per-VM overhead, or litevirtd itself. That is not a
// theoretical failure — it is how a 3 GiB lab node with 3 GiB of guests thrashed
// until sshd stopped answering.

// CapacityPolicy is the cluster-wide default, overridable per host.
