//
// UnsignedAfterSigned is different, and it is why the bare count does not need

// CA-signed declaration that this host's rows are signed from here on, revoked
// only by a signed retirement. That closes the hole the latch was supposed to
// close (a fabricated unsigned row with a recomputed hash verified clean,
// because the hash is unkeyed) without accusing anyone of tampering with their

// NeverAdopted is derived from a certificate row with no adoption beside it, and
// a certificate row is unauthenticated replicated data: any peer can insert one
// naming any host, using a certificate it merely OBSERVED (every host presents
// its own in every TLS handshake). That made a permanent, unclearable "TAMPERED"
// verdict available to anyone who could reach the cluster, against a host that
// had done nothing — and an operator who cannot clear a false accusation stops
// reading the ones that are true.
//
// The absence is peer-controlled in both directions, which is why no amount of
// tightening rescues it as EVIDENCE: planting the row forges the finding,
// tombstoning it suppresses a real one. So it moved to Unverified below, where it
// still fails the command and still gets printed — a host that cannot sign is

			// the tail of that region when it was written. Its stored hash
			// therefore commits to every seq-0 row before it. The region is

			// A host with no numbered row yet (upgraded and adopted, idle since)

			// the region is unsigned, unanchored history that anyone able to
			// write the table could already rewrite and re-hash undetected; an
			// appended row is no more than that. Flagging the region instead
			// says "tampered" for every honest idle host and for an attacked one
			// alike, which distinguishes nothing. Once the host writes, its first
			// row is chained onto the tail it holds, and a row appended after
			// that tail was loaded breaks the link and is reported here. Until
			// then the region's END is anchored separately: the host signs a

// "…10:00:00Z" though it is a nanosecond later. The ceiling never rose past such
// a row, and stampAfter went on returning prev+1ns from that same unchanged
// ceiling, so every row written while the clock was behind carried an identical
// timestamp — the strict ordering the clamp exists to preserve.
